00:00:00,Speaker A,"And finance. We're going to ask our excellent staff to call the roll and then we'll go straight into our first hearing and presentation. Bijan, please. Representative Baca."
00:00:10,Speaker B,"Representative Brown. Representative Chatfield. Representative Dow. Representative Duncan. Representative Garrett. Representative Hernandez. Here. Representative Herndon. Here. Representative Heda. Representative Little. Representative Lujan. Here. Representative Pettigrew? Here. Representative Sanchez? Here. Representative Salinana? Here. Representative Silva? Here. Representative Vincent? Here. Vice Chair Dixon? Here. Chair Small? I am here. Okay, great. Members, so we're going to go to a brief child care brief. This is an update from LFC. Members, this is just meant to inform the presentation. We're not going to dive into questions on this. Do encourage everybody, obviously, and excited for all of the stakeholders who are. Here today, and folks who may be watching online to tune in. And we'll turn over to Dr. Allegra Hernandez to kick us off. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. My name is Dr. Allegra Hernandez, and today I will be discussing the early childhood bullets brief, which looks like this. So, to go ahead and get started, as you can see on the chart on the left-hand side, you all as the legislature have invested"
00:01:27,Speaker A,"significant amounts of money in early childhood, where in FY12 it was right around$200 million, and in FY26, the early childhood budget is around$918 million now. So, the bulk of these increases were allocated to child care assistance and pre-kindergarten. And current funding levels are sufficient to ensure all levels of the city. Income three and four year olds in New Mexico have access to early childhood programs through child care assistance, pre-kindergarten, or Head Start. Each of these programs that I'm going to focus primarily on pre-K and child care assistance today, but on the last page, you have some"
00:02:09,Speaker C,"bullets about fit and home visiting. And each of these programs really are a tool in your toolkit to try and get to achieve different outcomes. And so, with that, I'll go ahead and move to pre-kindergarten. And pre-kindergarten in New Mexico was created in 2005 through the Pre-Kindergarten Act, and it serves three and four-year-olds. In the 2024 to 2025 school year, almost 15,000 children were enrolled. This is about 10 times the amount of children enrolled in the inaugural class in 2005. And pre-kindergarten has shown really good outcomes for children in the state. So, LFC research shows that children who participate in pre-kindergarten were on the first page here, that it has positive outcomes, including preparedness for elementary school. So, in looking at literacy and math rates, pre-kindergarten really is the tool that you want to use if you're concerned about accessing ensuring that students are adequately prepared for kindergarten. And additionally, it leads to higher graduation, higher high school graduation rates. And this is especially true for lower-income students who qualify for free and reduced meals. So, with that, we'll go ahead and turn to page two and get to the meat of it and focus on child care assistance. So really child care assistance is in prior to November 1st, child care assistance was limited to any family who"
00:03:43,Speaker B,made below 400% of the federal poverty
00:03:45,Speaker C,"level, which for a family of four is$127,000. Then as of November 1st, 2025, the governor and ECECD announced that regardless of income, any child in the state would be eligible for child care assistance. And one thing to keep in mind is that they're doing this currently with the existing FY26 budget of$450 million, but LSC staff estimate that the cost is going to be around$850 million annually. This is a$400 million increase or an 88.8% increase. As of July, 2025, the state has 74,000 licensed and registered capacity slots and serves 31,000 children with child care assistance. Since the creation of the expanded eligibility of early childhood, there have ECECD has lost 60 slots for children under two as of December, but they have added a thousand new slots overall. And so, this is one thing to keep in mind. And if you look in volume three on page 84, wait, I apologize. I'm so sorry. On page 89, actually, what you'll see is that capacity for our lowest, our youngest children has declined pretty significantly over time. So, if you look at FY19 in January, 15.4%"
00:05:04,Speaker B,of all enrollment in child care assistance
00:05:06,Speaker C,"was for children under the age of two. And this is in volume three on page 89. If you look in January 2025, it sits at 11.6. So we've seen a pretty big reduction in slots for under two-year-olds. And moreover, what I really want to spend the time discussing today is this chart right here, which you can find on page two. And so the red lines are every time that the state has expanded child care assistance. And as you can see, if we follow the blue line, which is for families at or below 100% of the federal poverty level, which to put that in terms for you all, a family of four would make less"
00:05:55,Speaker B,"than$32,000 a year to be under 100%"
00:05:57,Speaker C,"of the federal poverty level. So with that, what you can see slowly as you follow the trend line is that every time there's an expansion, the blue line decreases both in proportion and number. And so what this means is that every time there's an expansion, the state begins to serve less of our poorest and at-risk families in order to serve higher income families. And so there are a few things that the state is able to do to leverage this to ensure that by expanding to universal that we are that the state is not"
00:06:37,Speaker B,crowding out our lowest income families. And
00:06:39,Speaker C,"in order to do that, one thing that you can do is looking at tiered eligibility. In ECECD's recs right or regulations right now, excuse me, there's a tiered eligibility system that is not being implemented in which families who are lowest income should be served first, families who are part of TANF. And then it goes and increases slowly through income eligibility. And so this is an option at play. And there are several states that have instituted waiting lists. And this includes Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, and Virginia. So you can see that it's not necessarily a partisan issue in terms of waiting lists, but it's really just a practice that some states have included. Another option is looking at co-pays. So according to federal regulations, no more than 7% of a family's income should be used for co-pays. LFC staff estimate that if you started co-pays at a sliding scale for$250 million, for 250% above the federal poverty level, that the state would save approximately$11.4 billion. And so this is one option to the legislature in order to save. And in order to get family buy-in as well in the program. And so, with that, the last thing that I want to discuss really briefly is that child care assistance since 2013, according to LFC research, does not improve educational outcomes for children. So, what this means is that if you participate, and this is both causally and correlationally, if you participate in child care assistance, you are not any more likely to succeed in kindergarten or any grade above that than if you did not participate in child care assistance. And so, with that, I am happy to answer any questions. And thank you so much. Thank you very much, Dr. Hernandez. In the interest of time, we're not going to do questions here. Thank you for this presentation, members. We have this. Thank you also for the reference to volume three. And we'll certainly continue to work closely with you and our LSC staff. Madam Secretary. Great to see you. Thank you very much for being here. Thanks to your team. We'll go ahead and invite the Secretary, Ms. Dinsmore and Deputy Director Kelly. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair. Kelly Flunt, Legislative Finance Committee. And with me today is Secretary Griginski of the Early Childhood Education and Care Department, which we are just going to say ECCD for the rest of the hearing. I'm not sure which one is easier, but I also have my esteemed colleague, Mary Beth Densmore with Department of Finance Administration. And with that, we're going to start with the Early Child Education Budget, which is Agency Code 611. And your packet is going to look like this. It's going to have a quick fact on the first page. And you're all aware of, you know, that's kind of a good. Reference of what's been happening with spending and performance and audits over the previous fiscal years. I'm just making sure everybody kind of gets to their page before I start too quickly. Looks like I just need a minute. Everybody good? Okay. And then what I want to start with is let's just talk through the high level together. I think it's a good overall presentation of what the differences are. It's a big number difference, but it's only on a couple key policy decisions. And so we'll be able to kind of go"
00:10:42,Speaker A,"through this. We'll, of course, go through it by program, but this is kind of an easy overview for everyone. So we're looking at page four. Page four is the high level. It looks like this table with the yellow highlights. And this is a representation of the state general fund for ECCD. It also has two lower tables, which represent the Early Care and Education Trust. Fund and the"
00:11:10,Speaker B,"permanent school fund distribution, which voters voted"
00:11:12,Speaker A,"upon, and you all are aware of. And so, this"
00:11:15,Speaker B,high level shows those three major revenue sources and what the change is between the current fiscal year and the request
00:11:22,Speaker D,"or the recommendations between the DFA and the LFC for the coming fiscal year. And so, what you'll notice is if you look down on line 52, that first big table, the executive recommendation adds$163 million of state general fund or a 54% increase above the current operating budget. The LFC recommendation right next to that you'll see is a little bit different. It's only$13.7 million or about a 4.5% difference. So, you know, real close there. Sorry, all jokes aside. So, what we're talking about here mostly is this universal child care recommendation. That's the big Kind of policy discussion financially in front of you guys this"
00:12:07,Speaker B,year. And you can see where that's
00:12:09,Speaker D,"located on line 15 of the recommendation. And so you can see that 16, no, 15. You can see the executive recommendation put in$151 million for that recommendation. And you can see on the LFC, it doesn't necessarily show anything in that column. That's because it's a braided funding with a few other things, but it's a smaller amount.$5 million from the trust fund and about$5 million from federal temporary assistance for needy families. But what I will say is that we have some differences in pre-K, which is going to affect this recommendation as well. And you want to think about, when you're thinking about pre-K and child care assistance, you do think about them in collaboration. As Allegra was just talking about, they both have policy outcomes. Child care assistance helps families work and go to school and participate economically. It's really good at that. It was built at that. We show outcomes that it helps family income. Pre-kindergarten has been shown to change educational outcomes. Now, when you invest in pre-kindergarten, you're also investing in the childcare system in a way. Those are both care options for families. So when you put money into pre-K, those three and four-year-olds are going into pre-K classrooms, whereas they may be going into child care assistance classrooms. And so when you think about the two recommendations, it's the same mostly provider network. You do have it in schools and private providers, but they're both care options. And so where we put the money, that's the lever that we're pulling on what outcomes that we're focusing most on. And so why does that matter? If you look down, the pre-K recommendations between the two are a little bit different to the LLC recommendation has another$5 million in pre-K, early pre-K expansion, and that's from the permanent School fund. The executive recommendation also adds pre-K money, but this is important. So the executive recommendation puts in money for pre-kindergarten that comes from a non-recurring revenue source, and so it would have to either be not replaced last year or this body would have to come back and replace it next year. It's coming at the public education. As we think about how those revenue sources are put together, we think about child care assistance and pre-K as supporting systems, and how we complement those is how we think about prioritizing the funding and the revenue source. So you can see, I mean, those are the kind of the big conversations. You can see in the first P code, lines one through 12, both recommendations put about$4 million into home visiting expansions. Both recommendations put$3 million into the family infant toddler. So no differences there. LLC puts a little bit more using a different fund balance, a different revenue source for agency operations overall. And then, really, the rest of it is, you know, there's a little bit of support money for pre-K quality in the executive and the LFC, but the big, big difference is that childcare and that pre-K money. So, fit is the same, and home visiting is the same. So, those are your decision points, are really those two big pieces. The other decision point that's really important is language. So, the LFC recommendation has a little bit more language than the executive recommendation, and it has mostly to do with those leverage policy points that we talked about. The LFC recommendation has language saying that the department shall implement a co-payment system, and that would result in that$11 to$12 million savings that we were talking about for families, 250% to 400% of FPL. The LFC recommendation also has language that requires the department to implement the enrollment prioritization. So it says the agency shall have a priority enrollment of the zero to three population, the lowest income, kinship, guardianship, families, and families eligible for TANF temporary assistance of needy family. So those are two really important language pieces that are big policy decisions before this body. And with that, we'll just go over the difference sheets. And Mary Beth can also give any comments, obviously. So we'll turn to page nine. Page nine is your overall total agency roll-up. So you can see the big differences there. That$150 million that the executive is above. LFC in general fund that's the child care menu we discussed the 14 million dollars that you see LFC above in other transfers is uh revenue that the LFC put in from the uh land grant not from land grant from the trust fund um we have a very small federal revenue difference only 200,000 and that's some assumptions that the executive made above the LFC And then you'll see that fund balance that we talked about in pre-K, the executive recommendation puts that 4.6 million in fund balance, not included in the LFC recommendation. And the spending is differences are just those things we talked about. LFC did a little bit more in operating support for health care and risk benefits. The executive put in a little bit more for contracts and support for child care assistance in pre-K. The executive put more in for the enrollment of Universal. And those are kind of the big differences. With that, I will turn it over to Mary Beth for comments. Thanks, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. It's nice to see you all again. You've been seeing a lot of me. Just a couple of quick comments on the overall. Kelly has done a fantastic job laying out those differences. So I'm not going to take any more time to really discuss that. But I"
00:18:49,Speaker B,will just address one of the things that she mentioned
00:18:52,Speaker D,"was this replacement using fund balance in pre-K. The amount is about four and a half million, I believe, that we put in there. And I want to address two pieces of this. So the first piece is it is non-recurring, right? As Kelly said, absolutely non-recurring funding source. However, every year that the department does get an increased distribution from the land grant permanent fund, which pre-kindergarten is one of the programs that is heavily supported by the land grant. And the anticipated increase for subsequent fiscal years is definitely higher than 4.6 million. So there is definitely a pathway forward that should hopefully not cause too many issues using this fund balance in the budget. And then just to address the fund balance, as Kelly said, to be frank, this money should have been reverted. It was not. It was pre-kindergarten money, I believe, at the outset. The executive is just looking to use this up on things that"
00:20:00,Speaker B,"aligned with the original fund purpose. So just to give you a little bit of context there on the thinking in the executive recommendation. But overall, I don't think I have anything else to point out right now. So I'll turn it back to Kelly. Okay. So just, you know, in case you wanted to look back at any of your volumes, there's some discussion on early childhood funding in volume one, starting on page 50. 42, a really in-depth discussion of the LFC budget recommendation, volume 254. And then we have a plethora of early childhood tables on home visiting, pre-kindergarten, and child care assistance in volume three that might be really helpful in this discussion. And that starts on page 87. So, just a little light reading for you all. And with that, I will turn it over to the Secretary for comment. Thank you both, Madam Secretary. Great to see you. Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the House Appropriations Finance Committee. It's wonderful to be here with you. If I could just take a moment to orient you to the packet that you should all have from us. One, you'll see, which is a familiar document that you'll see is our universal child care brief. Looks like this. Just to let you know, all the data related to families and children has been. Updated since as of January 15th. So, when we gave this to you on December 11th, that was data up through the end of November. We know it's very important for you as"
00:21:49,Speaker D,"you make these critical policy decisions to have up-to-date data and wanted you to have that. We also have included a couple family profiles, and I think these are important to just humanize what this universal child care policy means to New Mexicans. We have Carmen Lazarin, who's at between 700 and 800 percent of the federal poverty, who's a detective for the Las Cruces Police Department. Tells a little bit about her story and what universal child care has meant. And then, who you met yesterday"
00:22:25,Speaker A,"in the chamber, Kenny and Crystal Martinez. He is a firefighter and she is"
00:22:30,Speaker B,an ER nurse in Albuquerque. And they're
00:22:31,Speaker E,"between 500 and 600 federal poverty levels. So, these are just a few examples of profiles that we have on families, and happy to share more of those. On the right side, you have an annual report. This is a statutorily required report. There are actually four laws that the department is required to respond to the legislature annually in regards to. We used to give you four reports, and a few years ago, we decided to make them all into one report. So it's everything related to Child Care Accountability Act, the Early Childhood Accountability Act, the Home Visiting Accountability Act, and I believe there's one more, and I can't remember what that is. But that's all in here. And then behind that report, you have a fact sheet from our Interagency Coordinating Council. And I'm so pleased to have here with us in the audience today, Kristen Mora, who is our parent rep on the Interagency Coordinating Council, and April Spalding, who is a provider of FIT services here in the state. And the Interagency Coordinating Council is a federally mandated body that advises the department on our early intervention program. And they are here, and this fact sheet is related to our C2 request, the Fit Kids Phase 1. This is a legacy system. We have a most viable product or is coming online here at the end of 26, and we want to move forward with Phase 1. And that was in the executive request for our C2. So just a little bit there. And then before I turn to sharing with you the House Appropriations Hearing Finance Committee, our 27 priorities, I did just want to recognize the executive leadership team of the Early Childhood Education and Care Department, fondly known as ECECD. And they are sitting here to the left. And I just, they really are an incredible group of people who work very well together. They work with community, they work with families. And there's what have brought us to this place here in the state of New Mexico to be the first in the nation to be offering universal child care to families. So each year we have worked, the ECECD, with the support of the legislature, to make great Strides towards building a family-centered, universal, comprehensive early childhood system that delivers outcomes. Our fiscal year 27 budget, the executive budget request, keeps that momentum going by strengthening capacity, improving quality, and holding providers and the department accountable for results for children and families. This executive budget also invests in the department's 2022-2027 five-year strategic plan with targeted recurring and non-recurring investments. Together, we are building an early childhood infrastructure that will last for generations, one that keeps universal, comprehensive access strong and sustainable for years. I want to talk on page one. If I can scroll to page one, this outlines the gap in the budget overview that you've just heard from Kelly and Meribeth and does it pretty clearly. And the executive budget. Reflects what it takes to maintain universal access, grow, and professionalize the early childhood workforce, and fulfill our statutory obligations. The LFC recommendation includes important investments, as you've heard from Kelly, but it also creates serious risks to access, to workforce retention, and to system capacity. The FY27 executive budget requests$256.6 million in recurring and non-recurring investments. As you see here, the Legislative Finance Committee has recommended a little under$77 million. That leaves a pretty significant gap of almost$180 million that has real consequences for families, providers, and communities across New Mexico. Here's the challenge: the LFC recommendation gives us$153 million less than what we need to maintain and expand current services, and it's about$30 million short of the capacity-building investments that we've requested. This gap will have a negative impact on. On the 9,390 families who've enrolled in child care since November, the 380 providers who have opted into the enhanced rate and are paying higher wages to their employees, hundreds of providers who are working to expand supply to meet the growing demand in New Mexico, and the states, rural, tribal, and urban communities that are counting on all of us to deliver. So, when you see on page two, who are we serving in universal child care? Let me get my brief out too so I can follow along. We are serving nearly 40,000 children as of January 15th. And what you will see reflected here is that we're going to walk through this, and you can see 27% of the new families are below at or below 200% of federal poverty. That's less than$65,000 annually for a family of four. These are our lowest-income families. Since the expansion in November, Seen the number of child care assistance contracts for this group rise. This shows how investing in universal child care is the access that lifts everyone. Here's what universal access does: 44% of new applications came from families who are already eligible before we removed the income limit. In total, 83% of our newly enrolled families are at or below 80% FPL, 800% FPL, family, I'm sorry, federal poverty level. That sounds high, but income alone often obscures the true details of families' financial picture. Families at all income levels are facing student loans, medical debt, high housing costs that threaten their financial stability. These are working families, teachers, nurses, small business owners, state employees who were priced out of the child care market or couldn't advance their careers before universal access. Many families at the top of the income scale. Else still needs support. We've heard from high-earning professionals who can't find care for their infant or lack full-day options. It makes it impossible for both parents to work, so one puts their career on hold. For others, this support means the difference between staying in New Mexico or moving back away from New Mexico to be near family who can help support the caregiving needs. It shows the child care affordability crisis affects families at every income level and that universal access is meeting a real need across New Mexico's economy. And as the research shows, it will pay great dividends, not only because of economic stability, because it supports early childhood development and what we know it does, but it also supports the prosperity and the future of New Mexico's economy. This budget also funds a critical need to expand infant and toddler care. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, only 10.8% of New Mexico families can afford infant care without assistance. Exactly where families need the help most. Infant care, as you see here, costs 86% more than in-state public university tuition. That is out of reach for most families. The next table shows that 37% of new child care contracts serve infants and toddlers, the most expensive and hardest to find care. That's up from 29% before we announced universal child care. Now turn to page three and it provides you a breakdown of the child care investments. The executive ask is for$160.6 million to deliver care to 56,800 children statewide, an increase of 24,000 children when compared to July 2025. We are on track to double the number of infants and toddlers served by the end of fiscal year 27. The child care assistance rates are often talked about, and we want to make sure you understand how we see those rates impacting. The care for children. Look at the table on page three. This is an example of a four-star enhanced rate. So, those are the providers who've opted in to our highest quality, to one of our highest quality tiers. A child care provider receives$23,100 per year for one infant slot. That's what we pay to support high-quality infant care. This chart shows you an estimate of how that money is spent. 65%, nearly two-thirds, goes to personnel costs, 50% for salaries, 5% for mandatory personnel costs, like payroll taxes and workers' compensation, 6% for discretionary personnel costs, life insurance, retirement contributions, and paid time off. The remaining 35% covers everything else that education programs need to offer, like curriculum and materials, occupancy costs, program administration, and small operating reserves. Here's why this matters and why our rates are built on a salary scale that starts with an$18. Our wage floor and increases based on credentials, experience, and role. These salary scales are embedded in our wage scale and career lattice, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. When we set our rates, we're not just paying for child care slots, we're funding a compensation structure that makes early childhood education a viable career. We're ensuring that providers can pay competitive wages while covering all other costs of running a quality program. This is how we achieved a 65% increase in medium child care wages since 2020. That's something we can all celebrate. This is how we grew the workforce by 64% while the rest of the nation declined. And this is why the$150.6 million cut to universal child care in the LFC recommendation is so consequential. It threatens this entire model. The wage scale and career lattice on page four, you'll see a brief handout of a page on now. I'm turning. This page, page four. We request$57 million over three years for the wage scale and career lattice. We want to be clear that this funding will not exist in isolation. We are improving compensation for early childhood professionals through multiple approaches, rate setting, as I just described, pay parity, and wage supplements. These programs all work together, and total spending for FY27 on direct compensation will be closer to 34 million. The"
00:33:58,Speaker B,total is even higher when you include rate increases. The
00:34:01,Speaker D,legislature has already shown strong commitment to
00:34:03,Speaker E,"the early childhood workforce. In FY25, you gave us$5 million in GROW funds to support educators who work with our infants and toddlers, our youngest children whose brains are developing faster than they ever will, and who require skilled and sensitive caregiving and teaching. Here's what we did with the funding. We launched a pay parity program for infant and toddler educators, bringing their Pay into alignment with similarly credentialed K-12 educators. The results are clear. Participants had an average of a 30% pay increase, about 10,000 per year. The program supported 188 educators in FY25. We also use these funds to support scholarships to help infant and toddler educators get on higher credentials, and we also supported coaching and professional development. We've run similar parity programs for pre-K and for Head Start, and we've seen the results, a more consistent workforce, better recruitment, and better retention. New Mexico is already a national leader in supporting its early childhood workforce, but the wage scale and career lattice is an essential framework that will ensure all these investments reach the workforce and have the impact we intend. I want to talk a little bit about our implementation plan, which we've laid out here very briefly on page four. Spring, we're going to launch a small cross-sector working group. Hope Kelly will be on that as well, and other legislative committee staff focused on four key areas. We know that we have the framework now, but we need to establish the administrative structure to actually fund the early childhood professionals based on the wage scale. We need to identify practical ways to track and monitor wages and credentials and create policies for measuring and crediting professional skills gained through experience and education. We need to build a phase-targeted approach to full wage scale implementation. On page five, you'll see we've laid out who we're actually serving across New Mexico and what this gap means. So far, I focused on the numbers, but now I really want to bring this home and show you what this means for families in your counties. The table on the back shows that newly enrolled families live in almost all of our communities, I think, with the exception of. Union and Hidalgo and Catherine are the only programs that have not enrolled any families since universal child care. But all other counties in the state, we're seeing an uptake in the support through universal child care. We do need to work to close this 179.4 million gap that we have between the LFC and the executive recommendation so that these tens of thousands of families and the thousands, tens of thousands of professionals who are serving them can continue the"
00:37:15,Speaker B,momentum that we've been on and continue
00:37:16,Speaker F,"to meet children's needs, families' needs, and"
00:37:18,Speaker E,"the needs of our economy. We cannot sustain services for the nearly 40,000 children with only 48 million or 19 million each year, which would be reflected in the GROW funding. And we want to make sure that our families across New Mexico know that they can count on us and they can know that we'll be there to support them beyond. Fiscal year 26. So, in closing, I just want to shift us now, unless you want to take any questions about that. I want to talk about the wage scale, but I just want to say that of the working families, I want to give you a little snapshot of who they are because they're in your communities. Madam Secretary, yes, I want to go to Kelly really quick, and then we'll come back to you to continue. Okay, I have just"
00:38:18,Speaker B,close on the families and then I'll
00:38:19,Speaker A,"turn back to Kelly before I do wage scale. Sounds good. Thank you, Mr."
00:38:24,Speaker E,"Chair. I apologize. I did want to capture, and the staff have done a good job kind of looking at who has enrolled. These are families from the agriculture community, military families at Holloman, Cannon, Air Force Bases, families in the oil and gas industry, the backbone, as we've described already, of our essential workers, our firefighters, police officers. And just let me share what one of those families told us. And that is a testimonial from Doña Anna County that shows exactly what is at stake. And I think that's captured in the story that we put in your family profile. And I received some emails this week from the Chamber of Mothers, who I'd never heard of, a wonderful New Mexico chapter. But one of the mothers just said, universal child care has not only saved my life, it saved the life of my child. And so I think these are impactful. I'll be happy to share those with you. They've noted the families, which district they're from, which House"
00:39:36,Speaker A,"district, Senate district. But I just, I hope that you"
00:39:39,Speaker B,all can feel really proud of what
00:39:40,Speaker D,"you've done and what we've done together because it was with your investment in 26 that allowed us to make this important policy change. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you very much, Madam Secretary. Kelly, please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman's committee. Just one clarifying point. The LFC recommendation does not cut the agency budget. It is a 5% increase over the current operating budget. The guidelines for LFC reflected lower revenues that were coming into the state that we haven't seen in the last few years. 5% increase on average, the LFC recommendations for agencies was actually about a 2.2%. So, this was a prioritization area for the legislature to invest in. And if you look at that opening page, when I started as an analyst for early childhood, we were only spending$150 million statewide. We're clearly over$900 million. And some of those years were years that we were in solvency, and the legislature still grew early childhood during"
00:40:46,Speaker A,those toughest financial years. Where some of you were here
00:40:49,Speaker E,"with us, and we have been in a really privileged point over the last few years where the trust fund that the legislature created and invested allowed us to do a lot of this work. And so, just clarifying, we did not cut it. It is a growth budget. It is just a different, it's not"
00:41:12,Speaker B,an 84% growth budget. It is still
00:41:13,Speaker A,"a priority for the legislature. Excellent. Thank you very much,"
00:41:16,Speaker E,"Kelly. Back to you, Madam Secretary, to on the way. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Kelly, for that clarification. I did not mean to say you cut our 26 budget. So I apologize from 26 to 27. The differences between the two recommendations. So, that is the"
00:41:37,Speaker B,"presentation on our FY27 executive budget. And then, I know you also wanted us"
00:41:42,Speaker E,"to talk about the wage scale and career lattice in more detail. So, if you prefer me to do that, can we do that briefly and then we'll go to questions? Yeah. So, just want to talk a little bit about what we have the commitment. Again, if we go back to the one page, that's all I have in terms of handouts on the wage scale. But pointing to that table that shows where we have been investing in the workforce over that, in partnership with the early childhood field, we have already taken significant steps. So, I hope that all of you received the wage scale and career lattice framework report and its recommendations. I'd share that with Amanda and hopefully everybody. I don't know if I. Have a copy of it, or anyone has a copy to show you what it looks like. But that has the whole framework in it. So, I didn't want to have a lot of slides, but I want you all to know that that's available and we can continue to do more deep analysis. But that document, that report, that framework was absolutely created by the field. And to remember, this is part of our enabling statute. So, we had to create a professional development plan, wage scale, and career lattice for all the programs that the department administers. So, we had Head Start, we had Early Head Start, we had home visiting, family, infant toddler, child care, and pre-K. We had advocates, we had higher education professionals, and we all worked together in what we called a change task force. 24 members working over six months, and that was the group that built the career lattice that you'll see in that report. There are different categories. So, in the professions, we have leadership, we have early childhood professionals. We have lead early childhood professionals, support, other categories, and then professionals who are already credentialed, physical therapists, occupational therapists. But this structure was designed to bring consistency and coherence to early childhood compensation. So for each of those types of levels, we identified roles that were in that within each of the four sectors, and then competencies that people holding those positions would need to have. And then what their credentials should be and at different levels. And then based on those credentials, what their salary should be. So I have examples of that, and we can continue to share more of that information. But with this structure, what we're requesting is funding to support us into implementation. So"
00:44:43,Speaker B,"in anticipation, we're going to work during"
00:44:45,Speaker A,"this fiscal year, as I shared earlier, with a smaller implementation working group that"
00:44:49,Speaker E,"will work cross-sector. And we will work to make sure that those wage scale and career lattices. Once implemented, do help boost the compensation across the field and then work again in coherence with our existing parity programs, ideally coming to a future state where they're all merged together and that we're able to support the providers across the ecosystem of early childhood"
00:45:15,Speaker A,"and the professionals who work there. We do intend for this to be coordinated with our reimbursement rates. We know that we don't want to pay our providers those rates. Those rates, over 50 to 60 percent of that rate, is about compensation. And so then the wage scale and career lattice will be added to that based on people's credentials and years of experience and qualifications. So that does everyone have the report? I just want to make sure. Yeah, we've got that out. Good. I want to make sure. Yeah, we'll get straight to questions. Yeah,"
00:45:55,Speaker G,"let's get straight to questions. There's a lot to discuss. You know, it's exciting to be talking about child care policy and wage scale and career lattice implementation. I know it's a lot in the midst of a very ambitious 30-day session, but we know this is important work and that again, this legislature, this governor have led on this. And I think we can also say the whole community has really led on early childhood here in New Mexico. Excellent. Thank you very much, Madam Secretary. Thank you to both of the analysts. Thank you to the teams. There is probably no state in the country that has made the jump from, Kelly, as you've outlined, where we were a little over a decade ago to where we are now, particularly in this administration with Governor Luhan Grisham. It is a point of pride, and we're excited to dive in now. As we all know, in a much tougher financial situation with far more financial uncertainty and risk facing our state than even when we convened here last year. So we're going to go straight to questions. We're going to start with Ranking Member Chatfield."
00:47:18,Speaker E,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. Welcome, Madam Secretary. I want to start by telling you how much I appreciate you remembering that there is a rural New Mexico out there coming to Tucum Carry, coming to Des Moines, putting in child care facilities there. And I think you've done a good job at that. As we've talked about before, we grew 100% last year, asking for another 50% over that this year. That's 200% where I went to school. And I just think that's a little tough. I think it's a little hard. And so I have a couple of questions. You said we're on track to double the amount of children served. Does that mean double the amount of children that have child"
00:48:09,Speaker B,care or double the amount of children that we're paying
00:48:12,Speaker G,"for? Because you really raise the amount. Well, there is no cap on the income, right? Before"
00:48:18,Speaker H,we were paying for the children of
00:48:19,Speaker B,"the people that were, you know, didn't"
00:48:21,Speaker E,"have much money. Now we're paying for everybody's kids. So, did we really get, how many, do you know how many kids were gaining into child care and how many were just paying for that were already in child care? Mr. Chair, Representative Chatfield, thank"
00:48:39,Speaker B,you. Thank you for the nice comments. And you make
00:48:42,Speaker D,"me think a point that I didn't make early, which is all of this is voluntary. So it's voluntary for providers to participate in universal child care, and it's voluntary, obviously, for parents if they want to use it. And it's for families who are working or in school. And so that's who the child care is meant for. And of course, grandparents raising grandchildren, we did exempt from the work or school requirement. And happy to see that we have 111 grandparents raising grandchildren that have since enrolled in universal child care since November 1. So, the question is: We will double who we've"
00:49:25,Speaker G,served in 24 by the end of 27 in terms
00:49:28,Speaker B,of whose care we pay for. That's
00:49:30,Speaker E,"your question. Yeah. So, my underlying question is: how many kids did we gain? How many kids are we paying for that we weren't already paying for? Mr. Chair, Representative Chatfield, currently we're paying for what was our and oh, there's 10,000, a little over 10,000 children whose care we're paying for now that we weren't paying for in October, just now in Universal. But by the end of 27, is that what you're asking? Kelly's gonna help out here. So, it's a clarifying"
00:50:04,Speaker B,question. I think we're talking about so
00:50:06,Speaker G,"the ECCD has capacity, license capacity to serve seven. There's 70,000 slots for child care assistance. We were serving around 20, or sorry, 31,000, and so presumably that. Gap was mostly private pay versus license versus what we were paying for. The expansion population, there is going to be"
00:50:25,Speaker E,a mix of people who were already in those centers who now we are the payer for. I don't think we have the data yet on what that
00:50:36,Speaker G,"mix is, how many are new to coming to a child care center, and how many were already in a child care center and we are now paying the payer for them instead of a private pay. Exactly, my question. How many are new? Exactly,"
00:50:54,Speaker B,"my question. Mr. Chair, Representative Chatfield, so"
00:50:55,Speaker E,"that's a great question that I think we can dig into and learn more. Right now, we're just helping you understand how many new families have come on and whether they already were in a spot that they"
00:51:10,Speaker B,were paying for privately and now they
00:51:12,Speaker G,have been able to have that financial relief. But on
00:51:15,Speaker B,"the universal child care brief on page 11, we did"
00:51:18,Speaker E,add a section to that appendix C that shows you where we were in September of 25. And so you can To see what our anticipated growth is
00:51:28,Speaker B,over the next four years for you.
00:51:30,Speaker G,"So, Madam Secretary, I guess I'm thinking we're not gaining double the amount of kids. We're just paying for twice as"
00:51:37,Speaker B,"many kids, and we'll be picking up"
00:51:39,Speaker E,"a few, but a lot of it is we just"
00:51:42,Speaker B,pick the cap off of the wage
00:51:43,Speaker A,"scale that we'll pay for. And so, which leads me to, is that untrue? Yeah, I think"
00:51:49,Speaker B,it's the point. We are unclear about
00:51:51,Speaker G,"what that number represents, but I understand what you're saying, and we can dig in and get more information for you. So, my next question, I think you may have said it a while ago,"
00:52:04,Speaker B,"but if you did, I was trying to think about"
00:52:07,Speaker E,"this last question. How much does it cost per child? And when you pass all that out among the family, what's the average cost per family? So, Mr. Chair, Representative Chatfield,"
00:52:19,Speaker G,"we estimate it's a On average, remember we have different settings, different quality levels, different ages. So,"
00:52:25,Speaker E,"if we're just saying average of everything, we're estimating about"
00:52:28,Speaker B,"a$14,000 per child savings to families. So,"
00:52:30,Speaker D,"a$14,000 cost to the state for family or per child. We're saying it's a savings overall. Again, remember, we're averaging all age groups, all settings, all rates to come to that. But we have a whole, so I think I'm thinking, I'm very sorry, I'm not understanding you. Is it$14,000 cost per child to the state? Yes. If you want to take an average, yes,$14,000. Yes. Okay. That's it. Thank you very much, Ranking Member Chatfield. Next,"
00:53:01,Speaker G,"we're going to go to Representative Pettigroup. Thank you, Chairman. I wasn't expecting to be so soon. Secretary, can you tell"
00:53:09,Speaker B,me when? We first started funding early
00:53:10,Speaker G,"childhood in the state of New Mexico Mr. Chair, Representative Pettigrew, probably when they first established the child care development block"
00:53:18,Speaker E,"grant back in the late 80s, early 90s. I'm going to go with major funding from 2013. Can anybody verify that, Chairman? Ellie has that. Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. If you"
00:53:31,Speaker B,"look at your volume three, well, actually, let's just look"
00:53:34,Speaker G,"at your packet. That's probably an easier visualization. If you look at your main packet, you can see that first page shows you on the bottom chart, it's by program, what we've been spending since 2012. So you can see we're close"
00:53:51,Speaker B,"to 200 million there, and now we're over 900 million."
00:53:54,Speaker E,"So by program, so that's where you. See the spending trend. Chairman Kelly, thank you. Missed it by your year. I didn't see that chart. So, Chairman Secretary,"
00:54:04,Speaker G,can you tell me when your office was actually codified and you took office?
00:54:09,Speaker B,"Mr. Chair, Representative Pettigrew, I believe the"
00:54:10,Speaker G,"legislature created it in 2019, and we officially began in July 2020 with fiscal year 21 as our first fiscal year. Thank you, Chairman and Secretary. So, if I understand from what I learned from your presentation, and please correct me where"
00:54:27,Speaker B,"I'm wrong, we spend about one-third of your budget on students and two-thirds on government. Mr. Chair,"
00:54:33,Speaker E,"Representative Pettigrew, I'm not sure we spend about 95% of our budget. On programs and services that support, care for, and educate children. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Secretary. Let's break that down. Programs and support. How much of that money goes to students actually learning in the classroom versus government somebody being paid by the government to do a job? So, Mr. Chair, Representative Pettigrew, I think an important point you're"
00:55:03,Speaker B,raising is that the prenatal to five
00:55:04,Speaker E,early childhood programs and services are delivered through our private
00:55:07,Speaker B,"sector, both through nonprofit and for-profit providers who hire people who are educated and do professional development, and they get then reimbursed by the state to provide that care and education. Intervention and services for children and families. So that's so if Mary Beth has the actual numbers by program? Mr. Chair Representative, this might help a little bit, hopefully. So overall for FY26, the agency's budget is just under about$990 million. Of that, their personnel is$36.5 million. And of that, their contracts are about$123 million. So if you, it doesn't work out exactly apples to apples, right? Because there could be some contracts that are direct services, right? But let's just assume conservatively, and it would be about 15%. Well, there's 772 million in the other category. And that's all the services that go out to the communities. And the other thing that I'll note is within contracts, home visiting is paid through contracts, which is also direct service. So this is pretty specific. Kelly might be"
00:56:18,Speaker G,"able to provide some more to help, but this might be something that we need to put"
00:56:24,Speaker D,"together and send to you. But I just wanted to give you kind of that high level that the vast majority of their money is in that direct services going out to the communities. Thank you very much. Chairman Kelly, do you want to add? Mr. Chairman of the Committee, so LFC's best estimate in the current operating year, direct services is about$856"
00:56:49,Speaker B,million of their$987 million. So it's a big portion of
00:56:52,Speaker G,"it is going out to the community in direct services. We can break it out, but generally we're in agreement with that. Chairman Kelly. Secretary, I'm going to. Struggle with some of those numbers with respect to direct services versus how much makes it into somebody else's pocket that is not in the classroom or is not helping. And I'm going to be very specific. I don't see that when I look at some of the numbers out there with early childhood with some of the expenses going out. I'm pretty good on reading those books. And I struggle with where we've been from when we codified this office to the amount of money we're spending right now to the growth. And let's just say third grade reading level hadn't moved. The needle hadn't moved. And we can talk about that. We can excuse it away all we want at the end. End of the day, we are throwing money to a system that is inefficient and ineffective. Mr. Chair, Representative Pettigrew, I think we"
00:58:06,Speaker E,"have excellent data to show that the investments are actually making a difference in children's lives. The recent data we collected, 98% of our kindergarten students, we collected population-based data on all areas of development. 75% of them are on track. We have seen excellent increases in biggest gains in kindergarten reading scores and in third grade reading scores. And 80% of New Mexico children zero to five are flourishing, according to a national health study. So I think the investments actually we have the data to show they're working, but they have to be sustained. We have to make sure that the system remains comprehensive and universal"
00:58:51,Speaker B,"and high quality. Secretary, I love to"
00:58:52,Speaker G,debate with you. It's fun. uh chairman i appreciate the latitude with respect to this um i'm an engineer by trade i can make numbers do whatever i want i'm i
00:59:04,Speaker B,can do static i'm a good statician i can i
00:59:07,Speaker G,can go through those numbers i can tell you what page and volume it's on i'm really
00:59:13,Speaker B,good at that I can manipulate numbers
00:59:15,Speaker G,"to do whatever I want. At the end of the day, the performance that the governor talked about yesterday, the performance that you're talking about today in my"
00:59:25,Speaker B,"30,210 constituents is not accurate. I don't get a number."
00:59:28,Speaker G,"I don't get a phone call from your office saying, hey, we're coming down. I don't get to meet with you at the same time I'm meeting with. The people that provide their early childhood, and I'm going to continue to have"
00:59:45,Speaker B,"a problem with that, and I'm going to continue to"
00:59:48,Speaker G,"fight your budget until we fix that. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Representative Pettigrew. We're going to go next to Representative Luhan and then Representative Dow. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the presentation again today as"
01:00:03,Speaker B,we're having this ongoing conversation. Just a few questions as
01:00:06,Speaker G,"I'm hearing both explanations of the budget, Mr. Chair. How many families that we are serving now"
01:00:12,Speaker A,"are low income versus others percentage-wise or numbers-wise, Mr. Chair? Mr. Chair, Representative Luhan, thank you for"
01:00:18,Speaker I,"that question. As we said, 44% of the newly enrolled were already eligible up to the 400% federal poverty. Yeah, and we saw some of our greatest gains in the under 100 and 0 to 100. And how many families that are high income earners are participating in current programs? Mr. Chair. And Mr. Chair, Representative Liu Han, would you would say higher, would you have"
01:00:45,Speaker B,a well yours is at 800% of
01:00:46,Speaker E,"44% are at 400% of the federal poverty or lower. And I need my team to do some quick math for me. Oh, tell me. 65% would be over 400%. Thank you. But if you're talking about the highest highest income earners, are they even"
01:01:04,Speaker I,"participating in our programs? Yes, we do have about 712 families who are over 320. 21,000 for a family of four. And where are they located mostly, Mr."
01:01:15,Speaker E,"Chair? That, Mr. Chair, Representative Lujan, I would have to have the team pull that data. Yeah,"
01:01:21,Speaker I,"I'd like to see a geographic spread of that, Mr. Chair, because we're looking"
01:01:25,Speaker E,"at economic development, and I'm looking at the other numbers that you're showing us on page five of your presentation, Secretary. And I'm looking at the areas where we have the"
01:01:37,Speaker B,"highest, where I see where we've made a lot of"
01:01:40,Speaker E,"investment from our own state dollars in economic development and growth. I mean, I'm looking at, of course, Bernalillo is going to be the"
01:01:49,Speaker I,"standout always, right? But we put so many tens of"
01:01:52,Speaker E,millions of dollars there. So I'd like to see a geographic kind of build out. I don't know if you've thought about that. I'm
01:02:01,Speaker B,"looking at Lee County, Los Alamos, Sotero,"
01:02:03,Speaker I,"San Juan, Sandoval. And Valencia. Valencia being really high. And"
01:02:06,Speaker E,"that's where a lot of the economic development is going. And so, when I'm"
01:02:10,Speaker I,"looking at the scope of what we're trying to do here, and when you posted on one of your pages about the$57 billion across"
01:02:19,Speaker B,the country where child shortages push parents
01:02:21,Speaker I,"out of the workforce, that to me is a standout for me of why this is really important. And I want to say, have you looked at what that means in New Mexico? Because I try to look at information and data in correlated events and spreads, if you will. And so to me, just looking at those numbers that you gave us across the state and where we're having all those influxes of dollars and where we know we're going to be putting even more in, like it's Valencia, we have, you know, Meta and all these big tech and further growth. That's where the families need it. And yeah, they're going to have more income coming into them, but they're also going to need the leverage of having child care if we're going to produce and create more families and have an effect or change on our birth weight, which then gets me into education. Do we know how much we pay for per child with the SEG formula, Mr. Chair? It's off the top of our heads, I'm sorry. Mr. Chair, I did ask every I've got some education experts on your I think it's about 11,000 per student, right? So that's per student across the entire state, right? For public education. I think it's a little bit on average, yeah. On average, right. Okay, so and you're looking at 14,000 per child for this program. With, you know, I think that we really need to look into these numbers and how we are taking care of our population in New Mexico with those with the greatest needs. And this is how we're coming to it. We need to, we're here to have discussions and"
01:04:22,Speaker E,"how we're going to formulate this to. Finer point, but I just want to draw upon those"
01:04:28,Speaker I,"things that I am looking at. And yeah, so and it's my understanding in talking to being here in Santa Fe, right? I, you know, we have different areas and different populations just here, diverse populations and incomes. And I just note that the families that I know that have really high incomes don't really participate in these types of programs. They don't. Those that are on the, you know, in the gap that are dual income, they are. And I just had a good friend of mine, and both his wife and he work and they have"
01:05:09,Speaker B,"to pay, they're benefiting actually from this"
01:05:10,Speaker I,"program because they have a 12-year-old child and they have a two-year-old child. And it's the two-year-old child that they're really grateful and happy to say that they are. They even said they felt a Little guilty because of their income, but then they were. I was like, Well, tell me about your budget and your family and your budget, and the income of four people living in Santa Fe, to you know, the house they have to more, all the things. And at the end of our conversation, they said, I guess I don't feel guilty because it's really helping us. And if we didn't have this in place, one of us would have to stay home. And then that would really inflict some, you know, cost to their family income. And I just want to say, when we looked at housing and we're had, you know, the whole how we were going to fund housing and expand housing in our state, and you know, we were like, well, what are those buckets, if you will, of populations that need housing? And we decided if we were going to have the economic development that we needed in our state, then we were going to have to dedicate a certain amount of funding to those types of housing investments. And so to me, this is very related to what we did there and serving. Everybody, and I get that. And I also understand to the point of what on average, this is my last question: what on average of those families that can't afford, that have higher incomes usually pay for their children for child care? Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, Representative Lujan, that's such a great question. And it's going to vary by the provider and the family. Oftentimes, that's why it's"
01:07:18,Speaker E,"so important for Universal. So we know that our child care providers are getting the level of revenues that they need to be able to provide the quality care. Because in some communities, they may just charge a parent half or three quarters of what the state's paying because they know that's all families can afford. And some they might charge them more. So I think this really creates the equity and the consistency that we want for our child care system. And we've seen 12% growth in our child care sector just by the strategies and the policies that we've implemented here by. Making sure the revenues are there. Our child care providers do incredible work, highly skilled"
01:08:07,Speaker B,and sensitive work every day for children.
01:08:09,Speaker E,"So it's not what the state is paying. And sometimes I think you make a great point, though. It may be so much, the provider might be charging them$2,500 a month, and they'll say, maybe I'll just work part-time or maybe I won't work because that's a lot of money. And we need them to work. We need a workforce. We know that's another challenge in our state. And so I think it's multiple things that we benefit from when we invest in universal"
01:08:43,Speaker I,"child care. People know they can go to work. They know that they don't have that financial burden. Their children are learning and growing. And our child care sector is strong. Yeah, and I just think with universal child care, inherently, those that need it the most are going to automatically get it. That's what we're seeing. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying to you. And I'm sorry, Mr. Chair, I just had"
01:09:13,Speaker E,"one more question on the pay and increased. To pay for the workforce. Those programs that pay more than that, how are they participating or how do they participate in the program? Mr. Chair, Representative Luhan, are you talking about the enhanced rate that providers are opting into? They can go into their provider portal that we have on our data system and say that they'd like to opt in. They can decide to opt in at any time within the month, and then they attest that they're paying their staff those wages and"
01:09:52,Speaker B,"that they're open 10 hours a day,"
01:09:54,Speaker I,Monday through Friday. And then their rates
01:09:55,Speaker B,will shift to the enhanced rate. And
01:09:57,Speaker A,they can go back as they see their model. I think a lot of
01:10:01,Speaker B,"providers, child care providers across the state,"
01:10:03,Speaker J,"are definitely waiting to see how we come out of this session. And we're excited, though. Over 348 providers have already opted in, and that's exciting to see. That was my last question. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Representative Luhan. Next, we're going to go to Representative. Representative Dow and then Representative Garrett. Representative Dow, please. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Secretary. Thank you, Kelly. I just want to say that I am so proud to be an early childhood educator. An unexpected pregnancy at the age of 19 kind of became the catalyst of that. My work experience was at an early childhood program, and I fell in love with early childhood. It was something that changed the directory of my future. I have a degree in early childhood, and I have been coming to the roundhouse since 1999 when we paid more for an animal to stay at an animal shelter than we paid for infant care. So I'm so proud of New Mexico's progress and that we now rank 12th in the nation for the quality of care that we offer. And that is probably one of our most shining stars in this state. It was a long journey of raising provider rates, creating parity pay, having Programs where there were incentives for quality. I have over the privilege of assisting over 40 low-income families, many first-generation to go to college, mostly women, mostly Hispanic, that now have degrees. 36 of them are working in the Truth or Consequences School District. So it is very rewarding to be part of this. I say, I listened to, I'm listening, and it's such a complicated issue. It's hard for people to understand if you're not in the middle of it. We're talking about this as an economic driver, and that is real. And then they say, but that's not educational. And this is really real. And then we're saying, that's not school. But when did infants start going to school? Six weeks. And you mean, we're going to pay for a home setting? You know, so I'm listening to all of this, and there's so many directions that I could go with it. But I'm going to start with my first question. To Kelly, Mr. Chairman and Kelly. Kelly, you"
01:12:45,Speaker B,keep making the distinction between pre-K and
01:12:46,Speaker D,"child care, but yet you mentioned repeatedly that there's a small provider network. So I know in my case, our STAR 5 licensed childcare, which was nationally accredited, parallels pre-K standards, and it's the same provider network. In fact, when the pre-K,"
01:13:03,Speaker J,"before pre-K class started, the families in childcare had the exact those children had the same teacher. Then pre-K started, pre-K ended, same teacher. And we're calling it wraparound, and somehow the child care part didn't have an impact, but the pre-K"
01:13:19,Speaker D,part did. What percentage of child care centers have wraparound that are also doing
01:13:24,Speaker J,"pre-K have wraparound? You know, Mr. Chair, I think we're going to have to go back and look at that. I don't have the exact number, and I don't want to miss you on that. And I do agree that pre-K providers are child care providers, and it's a continuum of service and systems. And that's why we try and talk about the two systems together. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I appreciate it, Kelly. Would you say that there are more ECECD pre-K providers that are providing wraparound services, or are there more public school pre-K providers providing wraparound services? Mr. Chairman Squinney, I have a spreadsheet. Let me pull it up on my computer. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And while you're looking it up, I'll tell you why it matters. When a child is three, when a child is four, maybe two, if they have special needs and they're getting early intervention services, and they don't have services at one site, their mom works full-time, their mom drops them off at seven and picks them up at"
01:14:39,Speaker E,"six. And they do that 52 weeks out of the year minus their vacation. Our expanded pre-K programs, I think, are at 1,200 hours a year. That's half of what a full-time working mother needs. So this system"
01:14:54,Speaker B,has to be integrated and it has
01:14:55,Speaker J,"to have wraparound. If you're going to a pre-K public school and then you have to go find another provider, hierarchy. If you have to go to another pre-K provider, that young child has to transition on a vehicle. They also have to have two sets of teachers, two sets of rules, two sets of curriculum, two sets of peers. There is a disruption in that. So there's a value to the continuity of care. Perhaps a mother would say, even if the pre-K program is at a star five school or a demonstration, one of the best public schools in the state, they might pick a star three center over that because they just want one drop off. They just want the simplicity of knowing who their child's teacher are. And there's a lot of simplicity to that. And would you agree, Secretary Griginski? Yeah, Mr. Chair, Representative Dow, thank you. Thank you so much. And thank you for everything you've done for the early childhood field here in New Mexico"
01:16:07,Speaker E,"and nationally. And echo what you say. And it's a lot happening. It's hard to explain it also. So thank you for those remarks. And yes, I agree. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I just, I want. I don't want to sound negative about this because early childhood's my passion and strengthening families and raising"
01:16:31,Speaker B,healthy children is my passion. It's really
01:16:33,Speaker J,"why I even ran for office. But this is when the governor said 10,000 new children, I'm glad you clarified because it's not 2,000 new children. It's, because"
01:16:43,Speaker B,I looked in the counties I'm familiar
01:16:45,Speaker E,"with, it's easy for me because I'm in this world to see when I"
01:16:49,Speaker J,"look at Socorro County, 44 children are in universal free pre-K. And I text my friends right away. There's a licensed child care center who opted in, and New Mexico Tech opted in. Those are not new children. Those are children who had the parents were paying that, nope, they might not have been paying because it's universal child care enhanced. So even"
01:17:15,Speaker E,"in that 44 children in Socorro County, if that provider"
01:17:18,Speaker B,was a star five provider and they
01:17:19,Speaker E,"picked universal enhanced, the majority, only the children under 400% are newly free, but every child would have been counted as new. You'd still have to break it down and say, out of those 44 children in Socorro County, if they were already under 400%,"
01:17:37,Speaker B,"they were already free. Mr. Chair, Representative"
01:17:39,Speaker J,"Dow, excellent question. They were, but they were still paying."
01:17:42,Speaker B,So these would be new applicants of
01:17:43,Speaker J,"whose care we're paying for. They were technically eligible to not pay, but we do separate those who were just being paid and redetermined as of November 1 versus those who actually are newly enrolled in the child care assistance program. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Secretary. You're telling me that in Socorro County, 44 children who'd never received any assistance before are now receiving free child care. Mr. Chair, Representative Dow, yes, that is correct. That is the number on here, Socorro County, yes. Mr. Chair, Madam Secretary, I'm sorry to disagree with your numbers."
01:18:24,Speaker E,"If I take an average, because we're working at averages, and there are 10,000 New unduplicated families"
01:18:30,Speaker B,"that are being served in New Mexico since November 1st. With your average ratios that you require, one teacher per child, that would require over 1,200 new workers. Where? And what"
01:18:42,Speaker J,"space? Because you're saying it's not in unlicensed care. Oh, Mr. Chair, Representative Dow came. I may"
01:18:48,Speaker E,"be stating this incorrectly. So it was a question earlier, I think, that Representative Chatfield was asking us: are these actually people who were never in a child care center who are now coming new? No, they potentially were enrolled in the New Mexico Tech Child Care Program, but were paying out of pocket privately, and now we are paying for their child care. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Secretary. I would have to look"
01:19:19,Speaker J,at their ratio. I would have to look at their capacity to understand what you're saying. I don't believe that that facility is big enough to have had that be the case. But if someone does. Offer opt-in to the enhanced universal child care. The families under 400% were already receiving free
01:19:40,Speaker B,child care. And that was the case
01:19:42,Speaker E,"at New Mexico Tech. So if all they did was move from universal STAR 5 child care to enhanced child care, you're saying they had 44 families enrolled at New Mexico Tech Child Care Center that were over 400% of poverty. 44 children were already enrolled. Mr. Chair, Representative Dow, I'm not sure. Is that the only provider in Socorro County? I guess"
01:20:07,Speaker B,"I would. No, there's two. There's just two providers. Well, I'm in Sierra County. It could be"
01:20:13,Speaker E,"out of school time care providers. Okay. Okay, thank you. But okay, so I'm thank you. We can get you that detail though. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and"
01:20:25,Speaker B,"thank you for that. Well, I really"
01:20:27,Speaker J,"want to shift to is the infant care because isn't that where we're trying to expand the most? Mr. Chair, Representative Dow, yes, and you see that in our numbers. Those are the largest percent we are. And"
01:20:42,Speaker B,we know we did look at our
01:20:43,Speaker E,"school-aged care prior to universal child care in terms of the percent of. Eligible children, and we're serving about the same percent: about 11.6"
01:20:52,Speaker J,percent instead of 11.6 percent of all eligible school-aged children.
01:20:55,Speaker E,"So, um, we know, and you know, firsthand why that's important to the child care business model: that you know, having that age span helps offset the high"
01:21:06,Speaker J,"cost of infant toddler care. But you are absolutely correct, infant toddler care is our focus. Yes, so thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Secretary. And it's it's where we need the most expansion. Um, but it's also the highest cost,"
01:21:22,Speaker E,"and everything you've been giving us is in averages. So, I'm going to shift to infant care. What is the cost of annual cost that the state of New Mexico will pay for a star five enhanced universal child care slot for an infant? Full time. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Representative Dow. I know I'm pretty sure my team can, I'm pretty sure it's$2,500 for an infant a month. I'm sorry, a month. So, someone help me with their quick"
01:21:55,Speaker B,"math.$2,500 times 12 is the annual 30,000,"
01:21:57,Speaker J,"yes. And then we have just Released our infant toddler contracted slots, which are only for infants and toddlers below 200%. And that is a little bit of a higher rate. But tell us what it is. Thank you, Madam. Is it$35,000?$37,000. Is it$37,000?$37,000. Thank you. Yeah. And that's they're providing all the diapers and the wipes and the support. They're doing the enrollment and eligibility. So it's almost like an early Head"
01:22:27,Speaker D,Start version of a state-funded. Okay. Thank
01:22:28,Speaker J,"you. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Secretary. Now, on the early childhood pilot, the infant pilot, did you get more applications than you had funding requests? Mr. Chair, Representative Dow, I don't think it's closed. It closed yesterday. So we would report back to you. It closed yesterday. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Secretary. Did you have to reissue that? We had to reissue it, Mr. Chair. Apologies. Representative Dow, because we had there were technical problems with our RFP. So that's why we had to reissue it. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just for the body to know, I have a lot of friends in the industry, and several of them opted out of the infant pilot because the$27,000 for an accredited site was not enough. Is that correct, Mr. Chair and Secretary? Mr. Chair, Representative Dow, I don't know who left it out. There were some important changes we had to make when we reissued the RFP that I think would have addressed some of what I believe the provider's concerns were, which did include the cost per child, but also some ratio and group size and ramp-up period so that they could meet those requirements. So it wasn't like on day one, giving them that 18-month period to meet those requirements. So hopefully we have a lot of applicants. But it is an RFP. Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's not like an application I can share much about. It all goes through our chief procurement officer. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Secretary. I understand that. Phase in out would be because each of those classrooms"
01:24:25,Speaker A,"will serve less children and lower the ratio. And therefore, if they're already fully enrolled, they don't want to supplant or"
01:24:33,Speaker I,"just kick someone out so that they can do the program. Is that correct? Okay. So we'll be able to serve less children at a higher price per child and then have to ramp it. I'm saying all of this to just rationalize in my mind. I want to, I looked up some data and I want to read some data. First of all, this is so complicated. And I have a lot of depth and understanding. And I still don't understand what's going on. So it's difficult to work on something with such a high price tag,"
01:25:13,Speaker B,vote yes with the three decades of information that I
01:25:16,Speaker I,"have, knowledge I have, and not understand it. But what really got to me was I looked up some research on what percentage of young families would choose to stay home if they could afford to. And some studies were as high as 88%. That was a Washington Post study. There was a recent Gallup post that showed 56%. And there was a Pew study just recently that showed 64%. And I'm trying to get to it, so I'm not getting this about. But I mean, if we truly care about infants, and then it seems like the most compassionate and effective solution to do it simple, just stop expanding government programs and let infants stay home with their parents. Mothers give the support directly to their mothers during their first year of life. We're sitting here and we're debating whether to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a baby in a child care center or in a home, in a classroom or in a government facility, an institution. This is our youngest children. Infants don't benefit from programs. They benefit from stable, loving attachment to their mother or their primary caregiver. The first year of life is not about academics or workforce pipelines. It's about bonding. It's about brain development. It's about safety. It's about emotional. Security. And there is no government program that can replace that.$35,000 a year per child, and the price is going to go up. It hasn't gone down yet. It's going to go up. And I'm just sitting here and I'm wondering: even those of you who are home providers, even those of you who work in an early childhood setting, if you had the option of$35,000, would that impact your affordability and would you stay home with your child in their first year? Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much, Representative Dow. Great"
01:27:28,Speaker B,questions. We're going to go next to Representative Garrett and
01:27:31,Speaker I,"then Representative Duncan. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Representative Dow, because we've been hearing a lot about Greenland and Denmark and how they have a one-year paternity or maternity leave. So, you know, that's something I think is worth exploring. I want to say two things. First of all, early childhood care as a profession has been profoundly undervalued. I always quote: teachers are nation-builders. Early childhood educators are brain builders. And I think just educating ourselves, how many people on this panel have personally arranged early childhood education for your child? You personally, this is a personal issue, maybe not right now, but you've had to juggle what we're talking about. Okay, I"
01:28:19,Speaker A,"would think everybody with a child here has, or stay home or go to"
01:28:24,Speaker B,work. I just think it's important that we reflect our
01:28:27,Speaker I,"state because I know my first, when I stayed home the first year, I was working in South Korea. I was able to have my child for a year. Made all the difference, although he doesn't remember a thing about it and complains. So that's where we got it. And I think that there is the philosophy. Some people simply believe the mother should stay home and that we shouldn't even talk about this. Philosophical viewpoint. But I want to say something that, Secretary, you really mentioned in your data that we forget about the family well-being that comes from good child care. Because when"
01:29:10,Speaker E,"I did come back to the States, my first provider was very not up to par. When I moved my son into a really good program, and kudos to the University of New Mexico Child Care System for being pioneers, I was at peace. And so, I, you know, the more I hear about it, the more I really support universal child care because it uplifts our families. I think that these two handouts from the single mother detective and the firefighter and the ER nurse, where are our shortages in New Mexico? Nursing, childcare, everything in the medical field, everything in the education. Field, everything in public safety. So, I would say, at the very least, Mr. Chair, the LFC language talked about priority. If we implement co-payments in a system, the department should prioritize zero to three care, kinship, tan of low-income. I would say we should prioritize for first responders, medical personnel, educators, and yeah, public safety because they have enough troubles. When you're a teacher, you're dealing with so many things and you have to worry about am I going to make it to the"
01:30:30,Speaker I,"four o'clock pickup of my child? You know, and you rush off. The story of the ER nurse and paramedic having"
01:30:37,Speaker A,"to trade shifts, the single mother who's a detective and a trainer and an understaffed, these are all understaffed females. That"
01:30:45,Speaker G,"we vitally need. So I would say at the very least we should consider adding that to language. And then the other thing that struck me: we talk about the childhood outcomes. I want to remind actually Representative Pettigrew: it's not third-grade reading that determines a quick reminder, Rosavigar. I think we'll try to direct our questions and engagement through the panel. Oh, sorry. I would like to tell you guys, Mr. Chairman, that it's kindergarten attendance that determines more about high school graduation than third-grade reading scores. And so these programs really support this. The other thing, Mr. Chair, can you just mention the impact on the middle-income families? Because one of the statistics was that a third of the newly enrolled families were actually already income eligible, didn't realize it. And so, can you just talk about? Reaching that from lower middle income to higher income, the impact it has on people that are often at the height of career development. Can you say something about that? Yes, Mr. Chair and Representative Garrett, and thank you. Thank you for those questions and for putting in context the real life experience of what it means to juggle and have to have child care. The data that when we met with you, it's actually been updated. It's now 44% of the newly enrolled were already at or below 400%. And let's just remember that's$128,600 gross income for a family of four. And so I think it means that we've, you know, we've heard from the educators who can stay in New Mexico because they were going to have to leave and be near family because they needed the caregiving. The real choices that families are making and trade-offs to work to their full potential, potentially go back to school and pursue a career they've always wanted to pursue. So our child care program is paying for families who need care. And voluntarily want the care. And I just want to underscore that: that these aren't mandated programs, but when we"
01:33:09,Speaker A,see a workforce that's struggling or people that we're trying to recruit to this state or to get into the profession
01:33:16,Speaker H,"who have a very real challenge of affording child care, that becomes a limiting barrier. So these"
01:33:22,Speaker B,"are our firefighters, these are our first responders, our educators,"
01:33:25,Speaker H,our health professionals. They're in this category. And that's why we want to build a child care system that meets all families' needs. Thank
01:33:34,Speaker E,"you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for sharing that because I think it's a profound point. And that's my only point"
01:33:42,Speaker B,"right now. Excellent. Thank you very much,"
01:33:43,Speaker H,"Representative Garrett. Now we're going to go to Representative Duncan, then Representative Baca, then Representative Little. Representative"
01:33:49,Speaker B,"Duncan, please. Thank you, Mr. Chair. You"
01:33:51,Speaker E,"know, Mr. Chair, I think it'd be interesting if some of our departments were"
01:33:55,Speaker B,paid by commission with the outcomes of what they are.
01:33:58,Speaker E,"Madam Secretary, I look at the program. I look at"
01:34:01,Speaker B,"your chart here on page one of, and I look"
01:34:04,Speaker E,at fiscal year 12 to fiscal year 26. I look
01:34:07,Speaker B,"at the rise in overspending, and I'd"
01:34:09,Speaker E,love to tell you that I see the actual results
01:34:12,Speaker H,in that. And I think we should be able to
01:34:15,Speaker A,see the results in that. So let me ask you
01:34:18,Speaker E,"a question, or let me make a statement, and then you might be able to respond to"
01:34:24,Speaker B,"this. As a county commissioner, I walked"
01:34:25,Speaker H,"through and I had to tour our jail. I had to walk through and I had to ask these young people where their moms were, where their dads were. And almost without exception, they didn't know where their dad was or he was somewhere, some other city. One time"
01:34:45,Speaker B,"in the eight years that I was a county commissioner, where a young man said, my mom and dad are still"
01:34:52,Speaker A,together. I'm an idiot. That's it. One time. I went
01:34:55,Speaker D,back to my county commission at the time and I said I would rather pay. mom to stay home and take care of her kids than what she's doing now and that's going to work all day coming home getting dinner for a half hour and then going to her second job obviously that didn't go didn't go over very well with my with my commission
01:35:22,Speaker H,"but i would rather pay moms or dads to stay home with their children because the benefits aren't just going to be short-term four or five years in school those benefits will be 50 years down the road with the problems that we don't have now that we do have. I think moms or dads can raise their children better than any daycare provider can, period. I don't care who they are. I don't care what they are. And that's"
01:35:55,Speaker B,what I would do. If I were king for a
01:35:58,Speaker E,"day, your department would be extremely small, moms and dads. And providing the support that families need"
01:36:04,Speaker H,so that we can be successful in this state would be my top priority. And I don't think that's the top
01:36:12,Speaker E,priority with you. I think the top priority with you is to make sure that moms and dads are out working and children are
01:36:21,Speaker B,in daycare or in school somewhere. And
01:36:22,Speaker H,"I don't agree with that. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much, Representative Duncan. Excuse me. Next, we're going to"
01:36:30,Speaker D,"go to Representative Baca, then Representative Little. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your presentation."
01:36:36,Speaker B,I'm going to be kind of very
01:36:37,Speaker H,"precise. Mr. Chairman and Secretary, what is your total budget through all funding sources that you had for last year? Mr. Chair, Representative Baca,$987 million. Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary, how much of an increase"
01:36:51,Speaker B,"was that over the year before? Mr. Chair, Representative Baca, I think it was"
01:36:55,Speaker E,"around 250. We increased the trust fund by 250. But the Mr. George is where about nine you're saying 26. Oh,"
01:37:03,Speaker B,"no, you're saying what I'm saying. Mr."
01:37:04,Speaker E,"Chairman and Madam Secretary. Okay, I think, thank you, Represent Baca. 800 million, just shy of 800 million in 825. Sorry, Mr. Chair. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for that. I thought, because I do remember that there was a there was debate and there was requests to"
01:37:25,Speaker B,"take more off the as far as the early childhood trust fund. I thought it was more than$100 million. I thought it was more in the neighborhood of$250 to$500 million. Mr. Chair, Representative, it was an additional$250 million. It went from$250 in$25 to$500 in$26. Thank you. And Kelly, anything to add to that? Yes, just a"
01:37:48,Speaker E,caveat that that is not a straight dollar for dollar. We did do some general funds. And
01:37:54,Speaker B,so that's why you don't see. If you look at
01:37:57,Speaker E,"your page nine packet, you can see the FY25 actual"
01:38:00,Speaker H,"revenues of$798.4 million and the current operating budget of$987.5 million. And while we did increase$250 million, those numbers don't map because we did some other revenue swaps. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Kelly, for that. My point is that we're growing this exponentially. So, Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary, so what was the cost of going from as far as targeting pre-K children to going universal in this past year through executive order? What was that cost? Because"
01:38:33,Speaker E,we went from serving pre-K kinder to up to 12 years old. What was the additional cost to that to the
01:38:40,Speaker B,"state? Mr. Chair, Representative Baca, you're asking about child care?"
01:38:43,Speaker H,"The children? Yes, Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary. I am talking because I'm going to get to pre-K and I'm going to get to school-based stuff here in a minute. So you know. I think it was$109 million increase in child care, but you will come. I think it was$103.$103 million increase in child care from$25 to$26. And that, Mr. Chairman, is up just through October, right? The$103 million was over last year. Or Kelly, you're shaking your hand. Yes, Mr. Chair. If we're"
01:39:18,Speaker B,"talking about the previous fiscal year to the current fiscal year, yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So"
01:39:24,Speaker E,"I also got the number where you talked about 10,000 more students served. And"
01:39:28,Speaker H,"my question, Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary, how many of those were school-based seats in classrooms in schools? Mr. Chair, Representative Baca, such a good question, as I mentioned earlier, of the eligible population. We're serving about 11.6, but they're going to give me the, I think it's around 13,000. Looking to"
01:39:49,Speaker E,"my team over there who has it, around 13, not of the newly eligible aren't 13,000, but of the total school-age children being served right now under child"
01:40:00,Speaker D,"care assistance contracts is around 13,000. But they're going to give me the number of how many school age, unless it's in the brief. It might be in"
01:40:10,Speaker B,the brief. Let's look at the child
01:40:12,Speaker H,"care brief. Maybe in here. Hi, brief. I think it is. I don't think I saw that. Which page? Three on your presentation. Page three on my presentation. Page three on my presentation. Okay. Thank you. I don't think so. Oh, yeah. There we go."
01:40:30,Speaker B,"There we go. Thank you, T. Page"
01:40:31,Speaker H,"two. There we go. It's not the breakup. Oh. That's the number of children by. Age group. And Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary, I guess what I'm going to say, and this is really the number of our three and four year old school programs or preschool programs, that's a percentage of age pre-K three, four. But I'm talking about slots and spaces in schools. That's the question that I'm having. What for the$103 million? So I know you'll have to get back to me, but I'm sure it's not 10,000 slots. Okay, Mr. Chair, Representative Bach, I just want to make sure for our follow-up with you"
01:41:16,Speaker B,that we're clear about the question. You're
01:41:18,Speaker E,"interested in school-age children, 6 to 12? No. Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary, I'm talking about your school-based, school-funded three- and four-year-old slots. Not"
01:41:27,Speaker B,the number of slots that we have as far as
01:41:30,Speaker H,"the capacity. I'm asking for. The number of school-based public school charter school three and four-year-olds. Okay. Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary. So, how much does it cost for a three or four year old school-based child? Mr. Chair, Representative Baca, I apologize. Will you repeat your question to me? Yes, ma'am. Mr. Chairman, Madam Secretary. Okay, so I"
01:41:54,Speaker E,"am a public school district. I have a school-based three- and four-year-old student. Or, you know, how much money does that student generate or does the school district receive for that student that's in my school? You have it, Kelly. I know it's between 14"
01:42:12,Speaker B,and 15. I want to give you
01:42:13,Speaker H,"the exact amount, but it is a per-child cost, and my team is going to give it to me. I don't know if you have it. Mr. Chairman, can I just clarify? Are we talking about the cost for a child, a"
01:42:30,Speaker B,"pre-K child in a school center, or"
01:42:31,Speaker H,the cost of a school providing child care assistance? I am talking about a
01:42:36,Speaker B,three- and four-year-old school pre-K program. I am a three and four-year-old. I am in school. How
01:42:42,Speaker E,"much does the district receive for me to be in that school if I'm a three-year and four-year-old pro? So, my uh, and I understand you can get back to me at this, Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary. So, let's let's just"
01:42:58,Speaker B,"say for for you know, just for round numbers, that it's about$14,000 for pre-K."
01:43:03,Speaker H,"It's somewhere around there. So, Mr. Chairman, Madam Secretary, so we're the school or the state is paying$14,000 for me to attend school, three and four-year-old school from Nine to three, or whatever. Mr. Chair, Madam Secretary, and then that same three-year-old goes home, and then now they qualify for universal child care. Is that correct, Mr. Chairman, Madam Secretary? Mr. Chair, Representative Baca, excellent questions. They qualify for wraparound, not a full day of child care, but they would qualify for a wraparound rate or for a few hours. And Mr. Chairman, Madam"
01:43:42,Speaker E,"Secretary, so the fact is, so do like, so I, school dismisses at three o'clock, the little the bus comes or my preschool comes, it takes me there as my parents are working or going to school or whatever. Is there a number of hours"
01:44:00,Speaker B,that that center will be paid for or is it
01:44:03,Speaker E,"unlimited as far as Mr. Chair, Representative Baca, excellent question. They would be paid what we call A wraparound rate, so it would just be for the hours. Maybe the child has to also go there before school starts and after, and then also when the schools are closed. So that's called a wrap-around rate that they would get for only a few hours a day."
01:44:30,Speaker B,"Well, Mr. Chairman, and I guess that's"
01:44:31,Speaker H,"what I'm trying to get down to and to drill down to. Okay. When we're talking, you say wrap around because I understood that. But we're talking about is that an additional four hours per day? Is it an additional five hours a day between pre before school and after school? I don't know if you have that, Kelly, shaking, so I don't know if we know that. We do. How many hours is that? Before and after. There are a certain number of hours. Usually it's about 10 hours a week about before and after. So if it's maybe it's more after than before, or it's a little before and after. And then, of course, during the holidays and you know, when they're. At a school, they would be all day there. So, Mr. Chairman, and again, you know, when we're trying to make this, I'm trying to very focus my questions, okay? So, I know many school districts have before and after school programs that are on site, correct? So,"
01:45:43,Speaker B,I'm talking about this child leaves my
01:45:45,Speaker E,"site and then goes to a preschool. So, you're saying there's only so many hours it will cover when that child leaves my campus. You said it's up to 10 hours a week, okay? So, if I need more hours, then what happens, or how is that covered, Mr. Chair? Representative Baca, you know, I'm trying to get a sense of what would be most helpful. So, the idea is that a working family who's going to a school-based pre-K"
01:46:18,Speaker B,"needs 10 and a half, 10, 10"
01:46:19,Speaker H,"and a half hours of care a day, what Representative Dow was referencing earlier. So, the idea is that we have three rates. We have a part-time rate for pre-K, I mean, for preschool-aged children. So, maybe they're not eligible yet for early pre-K and the parent just wants a little bit of care because they only work part-time, or they're a child who gets preschool and they need wrap-around. And so, that's a wrap-around rate that includes so many hours, and we'll get you those hours. And then there's a full-time preschool rate. So, those are the three types of rates that a contract that a family could get depending on the family's needs."
01:47:07,Speaker A,"So, Mr. Chairman and Madam Secretary, so we're talking about this. Let's say I work on Thursday, on Fridays, or Saturdays,"
01:47:15,Speaker F,"Sundays. My kids are going to need. So, the fact is, very quickly, if we're talking those hours, so I guess what I'm saying is that we're double paying for the number of kids, or there's potential to pay for them at school. And then, how much are we going to be paying additional for those children in child care? Mr. Chairman, this will be my. Final question. And this is, and Madam Secretary, this is about the poverty rate and as far as the high-income earners. So, Mr. Chairman, Madam Secretary, is there any difference? Representative Hernandez here, his household makes$325,000. My household makes$100,000. Is there a sliding scale or is there a different rate that's charged? Or does the person who makes$325,000, do they have that same access to me, who is really at that point 200% above the poverty? Yeah, Mr. Chair, Representative Baca, excellent question. Yes, similar to K-12, similar to pre-K, we don't ask income. We provide the same service at no cost. That's what we're saying with universal child care. And I do have your answer on pre-K. 8,762 children receiving pre-K in school-based programs. And if they're three years old, they're getting 16,225, the school is for that child. And if they're four, they're getting, you are more accurate, 14,730 for the four-year-old. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I think one of the, you know, when we're talking about, and this is hard for me. I'm an educator. I support education, but I support education pre-K through higher ed. And so this is, I just want to make sure that we understand and that when we're talking about growing, I think that we also want to track how many school-based seats are we providing along with these private center for-profit and otherwise. That to me is an important part of that because for the funding that's needed and those slots that are needed, Those the school-based programs are not growing at the same rate that our private school centers are. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank you very much, Representative Baca, and thank you for your questions. We're going to go now to Representative Little, then Representative Edetta, then"
01:49:49,Speaker B,"Representative Herndon. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm"
01:49:51,Speaker F,"dealing with a bit of a cold, so forgive me if I have to stop for a moment. I am looking at, I would like to look, Mr. Chair, at, or maybe offer personal experience. I think some have heard my experiences in the past of raising a child, one child, one child. And the level of and the difference in the types of care that I needed at each stage of her life. As an infant, it was really hard to trust anybody to take good care of my child that I didn't know. It's very difficult. And extremely expensive when I did check into it. Mr. Chair, I ended up using a lot, many of the time, looking to my parents, my mom, to provide that care. Someone who I trusted implicitly, just trusted to the max. And Victoria had a wonderful infancy because I had to go to work as much as I would like to have stayed at home. I could not. And at the time, her dad was working as well. We moved into Albuquerque. And what I'm going to tell you, Mr. Chair, is the experience that we had is a lot of what I hear the experiences are of people in rural and frontier areas who have to move into towns to where the jobs are, where education is available, and take their children with them, or unfortunately. Have to leave them with the people they trust. So that comes to my mind first. The next part, when she got into elementary school, we were living in Phoenix and living in Albuquerque, I mean, in Maryland. This was a time"
01:51:48,Speaker B,"before cell phones, before the time of"
01:51:49,Speaker F,"instant contact. She was a latchkey child, and it used to scare me to death, the idea of leaving her at home. So, back way back then, we had our codes to call each other. She would not answer that phone unless she got the code. And, you know, I won't give it away, but, Mr. Chair, we had to devise a way to ensure that it was only going to be me that she would pick up the call. As she got into middle school, just approaching middle school, there's another need there. It doesn't end. It never ends. And the issues that I faced of having to decide, Mr. Chair, whether to pay for a roof over our head, food on the table, and a vehicle were very much at the front of my mind. I knew where every penny went. And when I had to make a decision, it was a vehicle. I could not afford a vehicle. And I also could not afford to have after-school program care for her. This, as I mentioned before to some of you, to many of my colleagues here, is the experience that's not just faced by me, not just way back then in the 80s, but it's faced now. This is a game changer. The opportunity for people to have"
01:53:22,Speaker E,"child care where the providers have background checks, huge, where the providers have. Education, another huge factor for the parents to know that their child is going to be in a safe place, not just in infancy, but before and after they enter school, is huge. So I wanted to start by saying that, and I do believe it is going to be a game changer. Secondly, my second part of this is that children, as I understand it, in working with many teachers, children who are prepared to go to school generally are very fluent in their language, their first languages. They are ready to enter into kindergarten, first grade, those grade levels, and are ready to learn. Mr. Chair, we already have an issue,"
01:54:15,Speaker F,"a lawsuit with the Yazzie Martinez case that is ongoing. We went over some of the issues. In this committee, with regard to the public education department and this issue specifically, and we saw, we heard how children of color have not received, have not benefited from the education that has been available to others. It's not equal. And so I'm wondering, I see, well, first thing that caught my mind was zero, zeroing out of some of the parts of the budget of the request in the executive for air or for the Native American Early Childhood Convening. In my mind, Mr. Chair, and please the experts sitting at that table can tell me, in my mind, it's my understanding that these convenings assist, are developed, are available to encourage participation from those providers in tribal and rural communities. The this case travel-specific to come together to discuss best practices, to discuss advances, to discuss challenges that they're facing. My"
01:55:22,Speaker A,"question, Mr. Chair, is that, and is my understanding of this correct? And then,"
01:55:27,Speaker E,"and I would ask the secretary to respond, please. Yes,"
01:55:30,Speaker B,"Mr. Chair, Representative Little, and thank you so much for sharing your personal story. I think that"
01:55:36,Speaker A,"really puts into context what this policy means for families. Yes, that's exactly the intent. Assistant Secretary Dr. Joni Sweena has been doing the sacred beginnings tour and"
01:55:46,Speaker B,going around and really learning the in-depth
01:55:48,Speaker D,"knowledge that we have in our nation's Pueblos and Tribes and the language nests and their Head Start, early Head Start child care programs, and the opportunity with the first in the nation, Assistant Secretary for Native American Early Education and Care, to bring all those nation's Pueblos and tribes together for shared learning. Learning, as you said, best practices, and just really celebrate what we have achieved here in this prenatal to five period of life in a state that's committed to that across all of our communities. So that's exactly the purpose of that request. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Additionally, I'd like to discuss, go back to the discussion about the barriers that are still being faced. It is correct me"
01:56:39,Speaker B,"if I'm wrong, but limited, there's still"
01:56:40,Speaker F,a limited number of child care slots on or near
01:56:43,Speaker B,tribal lands and in certain parts of
01:56:45,Speaker F,"the state. The transportation challenges across these large areas also play a factor in this. And they're also facing some difficulty, Mr. Chair, recruiting trained providers. And mine, I'm hopeful that this effort, this This initiative is going to address these issues. And I see that it's going to require continued investment in all communities. And my question, then, to that, Mr. Chair, is what is the balance of the Early Childhood Trust Fund? Great question, Representative Little. Mr. Chair, Representative Little, it's around 10 billion. 10 billion with a B. 10 billion with a B. Thank you. And if, members, this is a great question. Kelly, can you direct us to the page in our volume threes where we can see the estimated balances or"
01:57:37,Speaker A,"the actual and estimated balances? Thank you, Mr. Chair. Members of the committee, if you turn to"
01:57:43,Speaker B,"volume three, your spiral notebook, if you look on page 96, that will give you the actual balances. And the estimated growth from our consensus revenue estimating group that works with LFC economists and DFA economists. And this chart not only shows"
01:58:00,Speaker E,"what the estimated balance is, so for instance, in 2025, you can see it's, or 2026, the current year, it's 9.9. And then you can see that in that red column, what the distribution is, that minus number is what we're sending out to the agency and what the future distribution looks like, given that we increased the distribution"
01:58:24,Speaker F,to 500 million earlier than we previously
01:58:25,Speaker E,"would have by the statute. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think I will end"
01:58:30,Speaker B,"my questions here. Much of the questions, many of the"
01:58:33,Speaker E,"questions I had were answered, have been asked previously, and"
01:58:36,Speaker B,I'm looking through really quickly to see if there was
01:58:39,Speaker E,"any. Else I had, but I thought that also, Mr. Chair, the suggestion that had been presented about prioritizing career areas for child care is important. But I"
01:58:49,Speaker B,"can't, I do support that. However, I think that all"
01:58:52,Speaker E,"careers are important. Every career that contributes that their parents have, a child's parents have contributed to this date. And it is a very"
01:59:01,Speaker B,"complicated issue. I'm looking forward to working on this again, Mr. Chair. Thank you for thank you very much, Representative Little. Okay, we're going to go to Representative Herrera and then Representative Herndon. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, presenters. Great programs, great comments. I'm curious, Secretary, have we"
01:59:21,Speaker D,"increased the payments for fit providers? Mr. Chair, Representative Herrera,"
01:59:24,Speaker B,"yes, we've increased them almost every year, except maybe one or two in the time that this administration, since this agency has existed. And so I can get you the percentage percent. I know just this last year was about an 11% increase from the year before, which we also saw an increase. Here we go. 11.4% from this 11.4 million. And that's from the trust fund. That's fit rates. But that's also, then we have Medicaid in there. No, that's a different one. That's the Medicaid. Can I get you"
02:00:01,Speaker E,"the exact percentage? But I know we increased it 5% the year before and then 11%. And so we'll get you the total since this is state increase. Is there an equal increase on the federal side? We work with the health care authority, Mr. Chair. Representative Herrera, we work with the Health Care Authority to set our rates and then. They give that to the Medicaid, and the Medicaid pays the same rates. Okay. So now let me go to the universal daycare. So if you"
02:00:37,Speaker B,"have one infant, it will cost the state$35,000, right? So if you have twins,"
02:00:42,Speaker E,"it's going to be$70,000. God forbid, should have triplets. I'm just saying, I got to just say, I got to say, that line through Ecclesiastics keeps running through my mind, you"
02:00:54,Speaker B,"know, a time to be born, a time to die. And I guess have you done a study on how much paid family leave would have cost for at least for the first three months of a child's life? Have you done a study on what paid family leave, if we let mothers or fathers stay at home with that infant for a three-month period or a six-month period or a year period, how much that would have cost? The state? Mr. Chair, Representative Herrera, I have not, but I know Secretary Black gave me a report from the economic development impact of what it's costing our state not to have adequate infant toddler care in terms of lost work and productivity. And it's over$563 million a year that the state is losing in revenues. So I think that we want to emphasize these are voluntary programs. These are voluntary for providers and voluntary for families. And so I think it's a choice that we want to make sure is available to families, fathers, and mothers when making a decision. Mr. Chair and Secretary, I understand it's a choice. I'm just not sure it's a good choice. That's all I'm saying. Mr. Chair, Representative Herrera, it's not$35,000. That's that infant toddler contracted slots pilot that Representative Dow was referencing. But I hear what you're saying in terms of the per-child costs. I'm just saying other countries have done it differently. And they have funded parents staying at home with those babies in the first months and the first, you know, sometimes all the way to the first year. I'm not sure we could afford that, but I will certainly call for a study to look at that because I think that's a really important choice that parents should have, along with these choices. I mean, some parents, I really, I know, and we know from the research, it's best if a baby's at home with their parents. It's just clear. It's just clear. I'm not saying all"
02:03:16,Speaker A,"parents, of course, there are exceptions. We have different kinds. I get it. But I'm just saying"
02:03:22,Speaker G,"for the most part, you know, that prenatal care, that breastfeeding, all that stuff is just vital to infant development. So, and I know you encourage that. I'm not saying you're against any of those things. I'm just saying I'm not sure. We're making the right choices here. And I will at least, Mr. Chair, I just don't think we're giving the parents the most important choice we could give them, which is really staying at home with that infant. So I will present a memorial to at least do the study and see what that would look"
02:04:03,Speaker E,"like cost-wise and what that would look like for infant health, which is really what we care about here: infant health. So, yeah, I just think we need to go in that direction. And I also, I must say, Mr. Chair, I worry about the impact of these costs for future appropriators. You know, there's a reason the LFC budget looks like it"
02:04:28,Speaker B,looks. It's because we also have to consider the next
02:04:31,Speaker E,"people, the next group of people. That sit around this"
02:04:34,Speaker B,"table, are they gonna have any money to work with to make any choices? And are we gonna, you know, you're sitting on the biggest gold mine in the state, and then we're asking for more. So I'll end with that, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Thank you very much, Representative Edretta. Next, we're gonna go to Representative Herndon, then Representative Vincent. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, presenters. So I have a basic question that I'd"
02:05:06,Speaker E,"like to ask. As we've been talking about these various child care facilities, there was a discussion about a five-star, there was a discussion about a two-star. So as I looked that up, a two-star"
02:05:19,Speaker B,provides basic quality standards focused on consistent
02:05:21,Speaker G,"routines and planning. A five-star facility provides high-qualified staff, a rich environment, and a superior health safety. Is our goal if we're going to actually give good universal child care to make Every one of these child care facilities at five-star. Mr. Chair, Representative Herndon, thank you for that question. We actually have two performance measures related to the number of providers that are in the five-star, which is in, I don't know which volume, but no, not all of them. I think we recognize that there is a continuum and there's different ways to become five-star. And we have our registered homes that also provide care. So, but we do have a goal. I think it's 66% are supposed to be. It's how many providers, a percent of under policy research and quality. There's a degree. No, he hits down here. Percent of provide of licensed child care providers participating in the focus,"
02:06:25,Speaker E,"which so that's the quality. We're supposed to be at 75 percent, 66 percent, and then those. Those participating at the four or five star, is that the 75%? 65%. That's your target for 65%. So that's our target for where we want to see our programs. And we see in the universal child care brief, you'll see kind"
02:06:49,Speaker G,"of where providers fall right now in terms of quality levels. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, providers. And I want to follow up on a concern raised by Representative Little. So she talked about on native lands the fact that sometimes transportation is difficult in getting a child to a child care facility. So I want to raise the question with you as I look at some of these schools throughout our state that provide automotive mechanic CTE programs. And what they do"
02:07:24,Speaker B,"in these programs right now, they take"
02:07:25,Speaker E,"these simulated cars, they build them up so that they can teach students how to fix a car, and then they tear it down for the next class. What happens if we, Madam Mr. Chair? Chair and Madam Secretary, if we had"
02:07:42,Speaker B,cars that were donated by the Automotive Dealers Association of
02:07:45,Speaker G,"America, or people donated their cars to these schools, and when students fixed them"
02:07:49,Speaker A,"up, then what they did, they would make them available to people who are"
02:07:54,Speaker G,"native lands or people who don't have the cars, because we don't have great mass transportation in this state. Mr. Chair, Madam Secretary, what do you think of that idea? Mr. Chair, Representative Herndon, I would have to learn more about it. I don't, I can't really comment. It sounds like a very ingenuity, you know, a good way to use cars or old cars and teach young people how to work with cars. I took car maintenance in high school, so I think that's good. But yeah, I can't really comment on it, but I think that kind of innovation are important things for us to pursue."
02:08:39,Speaker E,"And one last question, Mr. Chair and Madam Secretary. As I look at the work habits and, I guess, schedules of many of our parents. Of them do have to work at night, and some of these child care facilities, I hope, are offering. I've seen signs that say we offer 24-hour child care service. Are we paying them additional funds for that 24 hours? Because you talked about a 10-hour period. Now, I'm bringing to your attention, Mr. Chair and Madam Secretary, a 24-hour period. What are we doing to help them? Yes, Mr. Chair, Representative Herndon, thank you for asking for that. We call it non-traditional hour care, and we do pay 10 to 15 percent on top of the rate for hours, depending on when those hours are. But yes, so we absolutely recognize the value of that type of care and compensate it accordingly. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Madam Secretary. Mr. Chair, those are my questions. Thank you very much, Representative Herndon. Now, we're going to go to Representative Vincent, please. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Presenter Secretary. So I'm not big into child care. I'm just trying to, you know, I'm trying to figure all this out. And from the"
02:10:07,Speaker G,"inception of this at 200 million, and now we're over 900 million, how do we sustain that? And you're, I mean, you're at 900 million, and you expect that to expand"
02:10:19,Speaker B,and expand and expand. How is that
02:10:21,Speaker E,"sustainable? What's the model? What's the metrics? How are you making that work? Yes, Mr. Chair, Representative"
02:10:27,Speaker G,"Vincent, excellent question. And we actually have a five-year finance plan that outlines that. And it isn't, the reason that the cost has gone up is because we're serving more children and we're serving them with higher quality services, which means we're compensating the workforce better than we were."
02:10:46,Speaker B,"When we took office and when the department came into being. So it's not just money serving the same amount of children. So we're a little over 95,000 children being served across our four core programs. There's about 130,000 children zero to five in the state. Not all of them need all the programs. Not all of them would, the parents would want them. So that's our goal. And we know we have the declining birth rate. And so our plan is to be able to make sure we're universal for zero to three, meaning that 80% of families who need infant and toddler care will be able to access it in our state. We're 84% for pre-K. We're right now 60% for early pre-K. We'd like to be closer to 70%. And then for early intervention, of course, we are serving all those who are eligible. And for home visiting, we have home visiting now in every county. We're going for a universal model where every family gets at least one or two visits, and then families can have access to more intensive home visiting as needed. So we're a universal model, and that's why the cost of On up because we're reaching more children and more families and supporting your communities in a much more comprehensive way. And, Mr. Chair, Madam Secretary, you have$10 billion in the fund, and the corpus of that is$500 million, correct? No. Mr. Chair, Representative Ben said, the corpus is$10 billion, and what we get, the distribution, is the$500. Okay, sorry, I had that backwards. My ADD is acting up. So, since you now, do you plan on putting more into that fund so that you can fund yourself? Or I don't understand how this is sustainable. Mr. Chair, Representative, so are you? I just want to clarify, you're asking sort of about the longevity"
02:12:58,Speaker A,of the Early Childhood Trust Fund. I think the best way to talk about
02:13:03,Speaker B,it would be: there are inputs into
02:13:04,Speaker D,"the fund, right? It's excess school oil and gas tax revenue, that's what it is, and excess federal mineral leasing, okay? The fund reached the level that it did because for three fiscal years, the total amount deposited into the fund was about$8 billion. Going forward, the inputs are not expected to be anywhere near that high, right? Right now, we actually have diversions from the fund going to the Medicaid Trust Fund and the Behavioral Health Trust Fund. Those are in effect for the next three years. So they decrease"
02:13:42,Speaker G,"the ECCD inputs into the fund by half. Then it will go back up to the regular amount. Regardless, I don't think anybody is expecting to see$8 billion of deposits into the fund anytime soon. I say that to set up that we've run projections. For the fund. And$10 billion is an amazing amount of money. I absolutely understand"
02:14:06,Speaker B,"everybody talking about it. However, if the"
02:14:07,Speaker G,"department increases by too much more than the$500 million that they are now, it won't be sustainable in the far out years. So if the intent of the fund, part of it, is to create not just a fund to provide resources for early childhood education and whatnot, but if it is intended to be a permanent fund, just"
02:14:31,Speaker E,"as the land grant permanent fund, they don't have a lot of wiggle room to increase currently. The distribution. The distribution, exactly. Yeah, and we have run this multiple times. We've run it out to 2050. The corpus starts to decrease. So I'm not sure if that's what you were looking for, but I thought it might be helpful to give you that. Thank you very much. We want to go to Kelly really quick for additional context. Great question. And Kelly. Thank you. Just really quick. So the next time distribution is projected to put out any additional money is in FY29, and that's only about another 17 million. Now, I want to make clear that this$160 million that the agency is requesting for next fiscal year for universal child care is not the total cost of universal child care. There will be increases expected in FY28 and 29 as they ramp up the program. And so"
02:15:37,Speaker G,"just to be very clear, the cost, as you're talking about affordability, is something we're going to be talking about for several legislatures going forward. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you for that very in-depth. I wish we could spend 15 minutes together because I know that I"
02:15:57,Speaker E,"could get my mind wrapped around this, but that is a lot of money."
02:16:01,Speaker G,"And when we were talking about, not to change the subject, Mr. Chair. But when we were talking about paid family medical leave, we were looking at other states and it was not sustainable. If you carry out a program like this and you have all these people wanting it and they're"
02:16:22,Speaker B,"using it, what happens if it gets"
02:16:24,Speaker E,"to the point where it's upside down? What happens? Do you just start cutting programs? You start taking from other funds. What do we do? Yeah, Mr. Chair, Representative Vincent, great question. I know that's top of mind for all of us. It's top of mind for the governor, for the legislature, and for us. And I think it's we have we cannot forget what the investment of investing in this period in"
02:16:54,Speaker G,"life means to us as a state. Better health outcomes, better school readiness outcomes, better earnings, less crime, less juvenile violence."
02:17:01,Speaker B,That is the promise of our. High quality early childhood
02:17:04,Speaker G,system. And so a 13% return is double what we get on our own permanent funds and
02:17:10,Speaker E,our early childhood trust fund. So we're investing in our
02:17:13,Speaker G,"human capital. And that's the promise. You know, in two, three, four years, we're going to see results even better than what we've already seen in terms of school readiness and reading and other health outcomes. That's going to bring down all our costs in all these other areas that are, this is upstream work. So I think we"
02:17:37,Speaker E,"have to keep our eye on it. We have to make sure the outcomes are being delivered, but that's why the investment is worth it because the return is so strong. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I'm going"
02:17:52,Speaker G,to take a real quick stab at something that Representative Baca brought up. And
02:17:57,Speaker A,"this is the way I understand it. So the rate of a pre-K provider is 14,000. Correct? Mr. Chair, Representative Visit, yes. four-year-old okay"
02:18:06,Speaker G,"over 14,000 yes so um if a mother works evenings and weekends and she needs a full-time contract what does that child how much does it cost that child how much does how much money is that child going to be invested in is it double that mr chair well mr chair representative vinson so she needs um it depends how many hours of care if she needs less than 29 hours she just might need a part-time contract is she getting that in a child care home in a registered home what level of quality so there are a lot of things but that's where we've averaged about that 14 000 on average for a family but that's getting full-time care depends what her work schedule is she may be actually working full-time outside of the hours that the child's going to preschool so it would be then both so mr chair if you multiplied that times three if she had three children How much is that? 14,000 times three? Or is it 35,000 times three? No, it would be the. It's$42,000. Thank you.$14,000 times$3?$42,000.$42,000. So what if she just makes$35,000 a year? Wouldn't it be cheaper or wouldn't it be better to help her out at home? We're paying more for child care than we would if she just stayed home and took care of her kids. You see where my mind's going? Mr. Chair, Representative Vincent, I do. And I think those are the choices that families are making every day when they want to go to work, but they see the cost of child care and they say, I can't work. But yet they want to work and we need people to do the jobs that they want to do. So I think you're hitting on exactly what the challenge is. Okay. Mr. Chair, I appreciate you giving me the time for that. That was great. Thank you very much, Representative Vincent. Going to go to Representative Hernandez, then"
02:20:27,Speaker E,"the vice chair, and then I'll have some questions. Representative Hernandez, please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Madam Secretary, I always love all the metrics that you bring to the committee and the updates that I'm hearing that the hard work that your agency is doing, especially with our Native American communities. I'm seeing those results in real time"
02:20:51,Speaker B,every time I go into my community
02:20:52,Speaker G,"and I hear about the communications that your staff is having with tribal leaders. Mr. Chairman, my first experience of community leadership actually started eight years ago when my daughter was in the Shiprock Head"
02:21:06,Speaker E,"Start and I got elected as a Shiprock local parent committee president, which elevated me to the Navajo Nation Parent Policy Council for the"
02:21:15,Speaker B,"Navajo Nation Head Start Program, largest early"
02:21:16,Speaker G,childhood Head Start program in the nation. And New Mexico has 32. Head Start Centers in New Mexico. New Mexico has invested in the Navajo Nations Head Start
02:21:27,Speaker A,"Center by granting money to, I think it's a five-year grant. I've seen those investments happen, Mr."
02:21:33,Speaker B,"Chairman, and most importantly, the continuation of building the important blocks of language revitalization, cultural identity, and making sure that our new educators have everything to handle the stress level. Because I've seen early childhood educators under a lot of stress when dealing with the complexity of families and funding. Mr. Chairman,"
02:21:54,Speaker E,"I'm kind of disappointed with the zero dollars of recommendation for the Native American early childhood convening. My question is, is this convening, how many days is this convening held? And did this include the advisory group that you guys have formed with all of"
02:22:12,Speaker B,"the tribal, tribes, nations, and Pueblos early childhood education? Mr. Chairman. Yes, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Representative Hernandez, and thank you for bringing that Head Start perspective. And as a policy council parent, I know how hard those jobs are as having run a Head Start and really always appreciative parent leadership. We're imagining a three-day convening because there's so much knowledge to share and so much learning to do. So bringing people together, being able to be in a space together here in New Mexico for that convening. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Earlier, you referenced a 30% investment of return. Is that, Mr. Chairman? 30% investment return for each dollar"
02:22:58,Speaker E,"that New Mexico spends in early childhood education, Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman, Representative Hernandez, yes, that is actually what the research shows, and it's when it's delivered with high quality and with that intentionality that we're doing here in New Mexico. Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to flag that$400,000 to see what we can do to"
02:23:21,Speaker B,"help find some funding for this early childhood convening. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much, Representative Hernandez. Okay, now"
02:23:28,Speaker E,"we're going to go to the Vice Chair, please. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Hopefully, just a couple of quick questions. Do we have any data yet on"
02:23:40,Speaker B,any changes in the state's labor participation
02:23:42,Speaker E,"rate since announcing universal child care? Representative Chair. Mr. Chair, Representative Dixon, thank you."
02:23:46,Speaker B,"That's such a great question. You know, and you probably know this: labor data lags. But I will talk with Secretary Nyer and see what we can see just in this short window. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Secretary. And I think as long as there is a concrete"
02:24:07,Speaker D,"mechanism going forward so that we actually see that information on a regular basis, that would be helpful just to show that it is making an impact. Mr. Chair, Secretary, looking, we talked a little bit about the increase to the ECECD budget this year for implementing universal child care. What does the department expect its overall budget is going to be for"
02:24:33,Speaker B,"fiscal years 28, 29, and 30? Mr. Chair, Representative Dixon, thank you. That is in Appendix C of the Universal Child Care Brief, page 11. And so for 29, we estimate, or for 28, 714,237, and then in 29, 728, I'm sorry. So I just got to page 11."
02:24:52,Speaker D,"Could you repeat that? Yes, Mr. Chair, Representative. It's total spending across the four fiscal years ending in 29 at$728,760. Child care only. I'm sorry, were you asking my whole budget? No. Mr. Chair and Secretary, yes. So, I mean, we can extrapolate then. So, if it's almost a$300 million increase between"
02:25:13,Speaker E,"fiscal year 26 and fiscal year 29, and so if we're fiscal year. 27 and the requested agency budget in total is 987. So for child care assistance, we're currently spending about 400 million. The agency asked for$160 million on top of that$400 million to reach that$600 million just for child care."
02:25:34,Speaker B,"And then they would need another$114 in the next fiscal year, and then they're projecting another$14 on top of that. Does that make sense?"
02:25:43,Speaker D,"Mr. Chair, Kelly. Yes, it does. And so, what I"
02:25:46,Speaker B,"want to then get to is: if the agency's total budget right now is just shy of a billion dollars, in two years, it will only grow to$1.1 billion. If you were to make no other investments in any other program, just considering that projection. Right. That's only assuming child care growth. That's not assuming any investments in home visiting, pre-kindergarten, quality fit. And so depending on those asks, that'll be additional growth in the budget. Mr. Chair, Representative Dixon, that is the five-year"
02:26:21,Speaker E,"finance plan. And so I'll get the number from you, but I think it is around$1.2 billion, maybe$1.3, and it breaks it down by each of the core programs and the quality and infrastructure for each of those"
02:26:36,Speaker B,core programs and then rolls it up into a five-year. So it goes out to fiscal year
02:26:42,Speaker E,"30. But I'll provide that to you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Madam Secretary. Kelly, did you have anything that you wanted to add to that? Mr. Chair, no. Thank"
02:26:54,Speaker B,"you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. So if the disbursements from the trust fund stay"
02:26:58,Speaker D,"at around$500 million, which is The projection for what is sustainable for the fund, then the amount of general fund monies that go to the department will increase from just shy of 500 million to 700 million. Mr. Chair, Representative Dixon, I mean, I do want to just make the clarification point that the land grant permanent fund is considered general fund in our budget. And so that money automatically has to come to the department. And I think that's at 200 million. And so I don't think we have 500 million of general fund in our budget right now. 301. 301. It's 301 million this fiscal year of general fund, of which almost 200 million of that is land grant permanent fund. So I guess Mr. Chair Kelly. Yes, if you choose. To your gosh, I have so many papers. Your packet, which was handed out, I can't even find now. The, I think it's 220 in the current fiscal year projection. Yeah, 202, sorry. So, if you look at your page four and"
02:28:12,Speaker B,"your high level, it's rows 58 through 65. The land grant permanent school fund distribution ECCD in the current fiscal year is$178.3 million. The LLC recommendation is$202 million. That is considered general fund. So, of this, the agency's, what is it now?$300 million,$200 million is coming from the permanent school fund. However, I will note that"
02:28:34,Speaker D,"the permanent school funds language that was voted upon by the voters was for early education. And so, we have to"
02:28:42,Speaker B,"be careful on how we appropriate that. We can't necessarily appropriate. Appropriate it to agency operations or programs that don't attain educational outcomes. So it is controlled in a way that is not, can be spent on anything. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Kelly. Could we also remind the committee what were the changes that this body approved last year to the"
02:29:07,Speaker D,"funds that are going into the Early Childhood Trust Fund? And are the projections that we have in our book reflective of those changes? Yes, Mr. Chair. You're asking for what the big investments last year were to the current fiscal year from the trust fund? Sorry, Mr. Chair. Sorry, Kelly. So previously, all of the money was, you know, excess money went, rolled off and then went to the Early Childhood Trust Fund. But last year, there was a change that said. That only half of that money was gonna go to the early childhood trust fund, right? And then the other half was going to two different places. Am I correct? Mr. Chair, Vice Chair, yes, you're correct on the two inflows, which you can see on that page 98. You can see the drop in the inflows. Let me just get to that page."
02:30:09,Speaker B,"Okay, so you can see the excess federal mineral leasing line and the excess OGAS school tax. Those are the inflows outside of investments that are going into the trust fund. And you can see that in fiscal year 24 and 25, they were, you know, a billion and half a billion dollars. And then you see going into FY into the 27 that those declined significantly into 25 million into 60. And that's because you're taking half of the inflows and sending them for three years into different trust funds, behavioral health and a medical. Medicaid trust fund. And then, after those three years, this body will reconsider if they want to maintain those half-flows or if they want the flows to go back into the early childhood trust fund. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Kelly. I think that's really helpful because that was a fairly significant change that the legislature approved last year. I don't know that everyone knew that. Mr. Chair and Kelly, this question is for you. In the three-page brief, the key hearing issues, it was highlighted that the at or below 100% has been decreasing. Wondering"
02:31:30,Speaker D,"how do we is the and actually, Madam Secretary, this might be something that"
02:31:34,Speaker A,you can address as well. What is the plan to
02:31:37,Speaker D,"make sure that the folks who need it the most are the ones who are accessing these services? Because we do have pretty significant data that shows that it's going in the wrong direction. Mr. Chair, who would you like to respond? Or please go ahead, Kelly. Sure. Mr. Chair, members of the committee, so I pulled up the chart just for the audience and for the committee's reflection on this. And so, just a reminder of how we read this: every time you see that bar, so not the lines, every time you see the bar, that's a time that the executive has increased eligibility, made the eligible population for this service big. Bigger. And then the lines are the different populations that their income populations. So, what you're seeing is: yes, we made the population bigger. So, of course, you would see more higher-income families as shown by the yellow and the gray line coming into the system. But what we would hope not to see is the lighter blue and the orange lines going down, the lower incomes going down. You would hope that all boats would rise together. What happens, though, when you have a finite"
02:33:01,Speaker B,number of slots is you create competition.
02:33:03,Speaker E,"Now, I know the agency's goals is to expand those finite. That's the point of the LFC's recommended language: to try and do some preventative measures so that we don't do this. We still target the lowest-income younger children to try and prevent this from"
02:33:21,Speaker D,"happening again while still working with the executive. Policy decision. And Mr. Chair, Representative Dixon, I just,"
02:33:27,Speaker B,if I could ask Kelly a clarifying
02:33:28,Speaker E,"point, we had a good discussion yesterday about the data, and I don't know if this data is the same as what we were talking about yesterday, where it's limited to our child care development block grant eligible, or this is all children being served in the department. Mr. Chair, members of the committee, that's actually a different chart. This is the total population. That was a different chart. Thank you. Thank you, Kelly. And Mr. Chair and Representative Dixon, our trends are saying that more young children are coming into care. And so I think we want to really look at this. The thing that we've been able to expand, we've expanded significantly the supply of infant and toddler care. And we feel that's by opening up eligibility, making sure that more children are getting those higher reimbursement rates from the state. Vermont"
02:34:28,Speaker B,"is another good example where they have raised it to 700% FPL, and they've actually been able to grow a considerable supply just By making sure that more children are getting those higher rates so that providers have the revenues they need to expand their supply. We also, thanks to the legislature, have invested in supply building. We're looking forward to seeing those 1,400 more slots, mostly infant toddler, come online through the low-interest child care revolving loan fund. So, our trends are showing that it's trending up. We're seeing more"
02:35:06,Speaker A,"infants and toddlers being served, and we want to continue to keep our eye on it and work closely with the LFC. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Madam Secretary and Kelly. I do think that this committee and LFC are really particularly focused on ensuring that our children in the lowest income brackets are the ones who, you know, where they're benefiting and increasing enrollment. And so, Kelly, it sounds like the LFC language. Prioritizes that. Okay. All right. Thank you. I just thank you, Mr. Chair. Great. Thank you"
02:35:43,Speaker E,"very much, Madam Vice Chair. First committee, thank you. Great questions. Really good questions from committee members. Madam Secretary, a few questions from my end. Having overseen this, the creation, the implementation, much of it by rule, sort of the original. What is your worry about sort of fiscally being unable to meet obligations in future years? Or do you not have that worry? Sort of, but I think it is a worry that I that is fairly sort of being discussed. Yes. And Mr. Chair, thank you so much. And I very much appreciate the role of the legislature and the important oversight role that you have and making sure to be all that we're all good stewards of the public dollars. And I think the projections we've done and The transparency with which we're operating and continuing to keep you updated. I feel confident that the department can stay on track with our projections. I think the other examples of that are when you, we massively expanded pre-K and the scalability of that was taken on by the department. And I think that's been very promising, those results. Also, when we moved to 80% in 2022, 80%, 400% of federal poverty, that is, that was 80% of eligible families. We haven't seen everybody run through the door, but I think we need to continue to keep our eyes on it, go deep on some of these data points. You've all asked us excellent questions today about keeping our eye on further and building the supply because so many"
02:37:33,Speaker A,"families, we hear from providers, and I'm so happy and grateful to have so many of the wonderful providers in our state with us here today, have huge wait lists. And so people do want to go to work. They do want child care. They are trying to choose that and they can't get. That access. And so, by supporting our child care programs with these better revenues and these rates, they're able to grow their businesses. We're able to have, you know, stronger outcomes. Again, we cannot forget the important developmental science that says this is the most important time of life of a child's life. And so, if parents are choosing to put their child in child care, we want that to be the best quality experience. So, we're going to see the outcomes. I feel confident and also want to stay in close contact with the legislature, legislative finance committee, and make sure we're monitoring our data. Great. Okay. Thank you very"
02:38:42,Speaker E,"much, Madam Secretary. Yeah, very appropriate that we have this chart up. I think it's been touched on by a number of different members. My question here, I think, Madam Secretary, is: can we work on agree on guardrails to change the trend of this chart? Because right now, what the chart is saying is, as has been pointed to, Our most vulnerable families and kiddos, and particularly those with the lowest incomes, it seems visually at least their participation is declining the most. And that issue of sort of limited slots and workforce. And so, can we work on and explore? And does the department have both an openness to or perhaps even proposed guardrails that address what we're seeing here, which is that the families in most need in New Mexico financially are having the"
02:39:39,Speaker A,"biggest challenge accessing care? Mr. Chair, we are absolutely committed to making sure that our lowest income children get care. And that's why we're pleased with the results of Universal Child Care to show that the greatest number of families coming into Universal Child Care in the first two months were at or below 200% of federal poverty. So, we want to get with the LFC. We got with them yesterday about a different chart, and I want to make sure that we're giving you the most accurate information from what we're seeing and also what's happened since Universal. This is where we're seeing 37% of the new contracts are for infants and toddlers. This is all what we want, and the majority of them are under 200% of poverty. So, we are serving families way above 800%, but the majority of them are already eligible. I mean, not the majority, 44% were already eligible. So, let's keep having this conversation and absolutely talk about ways that we can ensure that the lowest-income children and infants and toddlers are our priority. Thank you, Madam Secretary. I think that's a fair place to move forward from. Because there are some differing interpretations, and it"
02:41:04,Speaker E,seems like some of the some of at least on the LFC side suggests that the greatest sort of proportion of new adoptees of
02:41:13,Speaker A,"this has been. Those above, well above 400%. But agree, I think your answer appreciate it, and it's a very fair place. Madam Secretary, I want to frankly just sort of note: it's been alluded to by different members. The House did pass legislation that failed in the Senate that would have provided both prenatal and sort of a first few months of payments to parents. It did not require parents to go to work. It did not prevent them from continuing to work. It did provide a per-child payment. And sadly, that was unsuccessful in the last couple of years on the Senate side. I do want to address, Madam Secretary, one thing that was brought up: which is the department open to supporting and advocating for a return to the early childhood distribution, wherein all excess revenues go directly to the early childhood trust. Fund and are not diverted into the other two newly created trust funds. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the question. So I probably want to talk with the governor's office. Sure. Very fair answer. Thank you. And there are always sort"
02:42:31,Speaker B,"of trade-offs and pluses and minuses, but appreciate that. I think those are my"
02:42:36,Speaker A,"questions. I want to thank you. I want to thank the department. I want to thank the LSC analysts. Members, what we're going to do now, I'm going to ask for the LFC recommendation in large part because were we to, well, for a number of reasons, were we to adopt the executive recommendation, it would spend more than"
02:43:00,Speaker B,what is available this year without other
02:43:01,Speaker A,"restructuring and rearranging. I do want to say, as we've talked about and as we've seen with this committee with questions and comments, there's a great deal of interest and commitment to work. Working closely together. And as we look at guardrails, either in statute or in other ways, and other things that deal with some of the challenges we've seen, it is clear to acknowledge the benefits that New Mexican families are accessing and some of the unique opportunities unavailable or sort of newly available. So, with that, we're going to go ahead and ask for the LFC recommendation. Mr. Chair, I move the committee adopt the LFC recommendation. Okay, it's been moved by Vice Chair Dixon, second by Ranking Member Chatfield."
02:43:52,Speaker B,Is there any opposition to that motion?
02:43:54,Speaker A,"Okay, will please show Representative Pettigrew in opposition. Thank you very much. Okay, briefly, members, we have"
02:44:00,Speaker B,"a hard stop at 5 p.m. Our colleagues had there's a caucus event tonight. What I want to do now is. Really, actually, what I want to do, I want to go to public comment. If you're here to make public comment on the early childhood education and care department, please raise your hand. Okay, we're going to invite, we're limiting it to, and we'll ask folks just to keep it down a bit. We're going to invite folks up to give a minute worth of public comment. Whatever time we have remaining, we're going to move to our next two agencies. If we're unable to meet that, then expect tomorrow and the next few days to be a little bit later. To the secretaries and agencies, I want to extend my thanks and also apologies. But with that, if you're here to make public comment, please line up in the middle. And a big thanks to our sergeant for okay, for one minute, please. And the vice chair will keep the time. Thanks so much. Yes, thank you for allowing me. My name is Rosa Parraza. I represent the Early Care and Learning Association, which is comprised of over 310 providers. We are here in support of the universal child care. We see"
02:45:30,Speaker A,it as an economic advantage for the
02:45:31,Speaker B,"state. We also look at the welfare of families and children under our care. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, my name is Olga Grace. I am a daycare"
02:45:42,Speaker A,owner and provider. I also have a
02:45:43,Speaker B,"bachelor's in social work. So I was a little bothered by a comment meant that kids really don't develop or learn at zero to three years. In my human development class, I learned that that's when the brain actually grows the most. Okay, so they go from not talking, crying to get attention and communication to actually full sentences by the time they leave my house. So it's very important. Second thing is that we heard a question: you know, do they read by the time they're three years old? I think we're forgetting something very important. New Mexico ranks 50 in neglect and child abuse. Okay, and that's embarrassing. So, for you to worry about whether they're reading by the time they're in third grade, there's much bigger problems that we have. As I mentioned, I'm a social worker. I do have service. Please go ahead and conclude your comments. Kids that are in foster care. Out of my daycare, 10 kids have been adopted by loving families who can break cycles. Great. Thank you. Early education is important. Thank you"
02:47:00,Speaker G,"very much. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. I'm Jacob V. Hill with New Mexico Voices for Children. We strongly are encouraged by and celebrate the expansion of child care. It's incredible. It's incredible to be so proud. Of what our state has done even before the announcement of universal child care. We're encouraged by the expansion of care to low-income and infants and toddlers. You have many"
02:47:28,Speaker A,factors to consider when building the budget. I want to
02:47:31,Speaker D,"focus on the workforce, they're the key"
02:47:33,Speaker I,"to continued progress. Wages have increased, partly due to the policies outlined by the Secretary, but we need to make this systemic and permanent through funding and implementing the wage and career ladder, preferably with recurring dollars. The professionals who will be making this historic expansion happen deserve fair compensation and a clear path in this field. The investments in this system will endure beyond this administration, and we all have to make sure they're sufficient and sustainable. As Rep Garrett said, these are professional brain builders who make this system, including support staff like bus drivers who are a part of the wage and career ladder. To Representative Little's point, so we thank you for your role in making this through your hard work on this year's budget. Thank"
02:48:27,Speaker B,"you. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and committee members. I'm Matthew Henderson from the Olay Education Fund. We want to thank you for supporting the expansion of universal child care. We want to encourage you to increase the allocation for the wage and career ladder with recurring funding, because without giving our early educators wage increases across the board, we cannot possibly expect to meet the demand for child care. Great. Thank you very much. Good evening. My name is April Spaulding. I'm the executive director at Abrazos Family Support Services. We are an early intervention agency providing services to Bernalillo and Sandoval County for over 45 years. We're here to ask for your support for ECECD's one-time funding request for$2.25 million to expand our Fit Kids revamp. This is a system that actually would allow us to provide you with the needed information as well as the federal government. In order to measure outcomes, services, et cetera. I also would like to ask"
02:49:36,Speaker A,for the expanded funding for the career and wage lattice
02:49:39,Speaker I,"implementation. I was a member of the task force. If we don't have a workforce to deliver these services to the children and families, particularly those with developmental delays and disabilities, we will fall out of both federal and state mandates. So please consider expansion of that. Thank you for your service. Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for your time, Mr. Chair. My name is Teresa Madrid. I'm with the Partnership for Community Action. We have a network of over 100 child care providers who we've been working with for the last decade. What we know"
02:50:19,Speaker A,"is, and what you heard today, is"
02:50:21,Speaker B,the system is complex. There are so
02:50:22,Speaker I,"many moving pieces. And what is really important and critical to understand is that providers are giving service to care for children and then getting reimbursed by the state. They're having to navigate those dollar amounts to cover the cost of their business. Care for the child and payroll. And what's not very easy for them is to have a very simple and structured way to get dignified wages. For decades, our child care providers have been working under poverty wages, and we're just barely catching up. But we need a better system with the wage and career ladder that has, quite frankly, already been created. The department has done a great job creating a professional development system. Please conclude yourself. And with all the pieces in place, we think that the reality is the wage and career ladder needs to be there for universal child care to work. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. My name is Tracy McDaniel. I'm with the Southwest Women's Law Center. I heard lots of discussion today about sustainability,"
02:51:39,Speaker B,but really sustainability depends on high-quality interactions
02:51:40,Speaker A,with well-qualified professionals. So we must invest in dignified wages for the early childhood. Workforce. The wage and career lattice is necessary in order for this to be sustainable. We can't continue to fund this through grow funds.
02:51:55,Speaker B,"It must be recurring funds to truly ensure that we have we're building confidence in that workforce for the recruitment and retention that's necessary for a truly sustainable child care system. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. My name is Barbara Luna Tedro. I'm a provider in Farmington. I'm also policy chair and incoming president for the New Mexico Early Childhood Association. During today's questions, and I do want to just talk about some of those things, I know that Representative Pettigrew, when you were talking about the budget and you were outlining the cost of the biggest cost in childcare, is the staffing, and that can take up 60 to 70 percent of a revenue. That doesn't mean that a child care center owner then has 30 percent that they are taking from the state, it is actually five percent, and so to Just reiterate that the other expenses come on top of that. To answer Representative Mr. Baca, you were talking about pre-K"
02:53:07,Speaker A,in the public schools and then wraparound care. The reason that the state has
02:53:12,Speaker B,gone to a mixed delivery system for New Mexico pre-K are for those working families so that
02:53:18,Speaker A,"if they only need New Mexico pre-K, they can go to a public school"
02:53:22,Speaker B,"setting from 9 to 3. There are no other costs associated with they can go home. However, if they do need wraparound, then they would come try to find a center like myself that is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. to minimize those dollars where they get New Mexico pre-K and then we only get a small wraparound rate for child care. Thank you. Great. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you all very much. That concludes public comment. Oh, sorry, we're online too. Excellent. Okay, we're going to start with Cassandra"
02:54:01,Speaker A,"de Camp. Cassandra, go ahead for one minute, please. Thank you. Can you hear"
02:54:06,Speaker B,"me, Mr. Chair? Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the committee. My name is Cassandra DeCamp. I am a parent of a child who accessed early intervention services, so I'm going to focus solely there. I echo the same sentiments shared by Ms. April Spalding about funding early intervention, but I want to focus more"
02:54:28,Speaker A,on the wage scale and career lattice. I do feel it's important that we
02:54:33,Speaker B,"pay our providers what they need to be paid to provide that high-quality care that Secretary Gerginski referenced several times during her presentation. I also want to make sure that we not only look inside the early childhood ecosystem, but that we apply that throughout any sort of community that can access these services where employees might migrate from serving, let's just say, other members who are served through the health care authority or through aging and long-term services to go over to early child care and work because the wage is higher. So I would encourage not only do we implement that in the early childhood eco care system, especially since we're seeing more medical. Complex children who"
02:55:22,Speaker A,"need these early childhood services, please look outside. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair and I'm thank"
02:55:28,Speaker B,"you very much. Okay, we'll go to Tina Patel. Tina, go ahead for one minute if you can hear us, please."
02:55:36,Speaker A,"I'm sorry, can you hear me now? We sure can. I started talking. My name is Tina"
02:55:42,Speaker B,Patel. I am the owner of Montessori One Academy in Albuquerque and president of Montessori Network of
02:55:48,Speaker A,"New Mexico. And first, I would like to start by saying I wholeheartedly support universal child care and the career ladder."
02:55:55,Speaker B,I am ashamed and appalled at some
02:55:57,Speaker A,of the representatives here who are suggesting that children should
02:56:00,Speaker B,be staying at home with their mothers. It is not. Please continue on. We're trying to keep
02:56:06,Speaker A,the comments. I understand. I understand. And to provide paid
02:56:09,Speaker B,"family leave as an option, you're putting now a burden on the small businesses, which actually runs our economy. If you want to save money, please look at professional liability insurances that all early childhood care providers need to be caring. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Okay, now we're going to conclude with Ruth Porta. Hello. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and members of the committee. I am Ruth Porta, provider in Aluquerque and Rio Rancho. I am here to support universal childcare. As you know, we have a crisis labor with medical and law enforcement personnel. Percent of population that the secretary mentioned that enroll in universal child care. The majority is firefighters, nurses, political police officers, sheriffs. Universal child care will not only improve our economy but also will attract that person that our state really"
02:57:07,Speaker A,"needs. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, we saw one more hand go up. We're going to go to Elaine, please. Elaine, go ahead if you can, if we can go off and mute. We're going to move on. Brandy Corey from Paso Styles, and then we're going to conclude with Brandy. Go ahead, please. Brandy, you need to come off of mute. Oh, forgive me. I'm sorry. My name is Brandy Corey. Thank you, Chair, for letting me know I was muted. I'm with the Pasoa Paso Network in Taos County, which is one of the ECECD Early Childhood"
02:57:49,Speaker B,"Systems Building Coalitions. And I know that the LFC recommendations do not include the coalitions as a non-reoccurring allocation. I just want to urge this committee to reconsider that as the coalitions are the way that we make work happen in our local communities. So when you want success and you want collaborative success that makes an impact in a local community, especially rural communities, I think you need to consider that. Little bit of funding to make it happen where you are. Thank you for hearing me. Okay, thank you very much. We appreciate that very much. Okay, that concludes public comment. We're unfortunately basically at the five o'clock hour. Secretaries will connect with you and look to reschedule as quickly as possible this week. This doesn't happen but for caucus, sort of caucus events, which are very rare, but dinners in that are part of that. And so we will reconvene tomorrow and Secretary Kaltenbach, Secretary DeBosi will be in touch and reschedule quickly. All right. Thank you. And thank you, members, for the good work today. We're adjourned."
