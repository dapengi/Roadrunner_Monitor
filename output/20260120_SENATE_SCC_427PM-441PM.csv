00:00:00,Speaker A,"First meeting, we will be meeting daily. We'll try 10:30, see if that works. The last 30 days we started at 10:30. By the end of it, we were only doing a quarter of 11. So, three things on the agenda: we're gonna hear a little bit from our new secretary and welcome her. We're gonna hear from our chief clerk because we've got just a few little things that we have to approve. The good news is we're gonna increase our franking privileges to match the increase in the postage. Then, we are going to deal with the three bills that were read out today"
00:00:57,Speaker B,"on the floor, and then we will pass a new committee list. All right, so let's hear from Lauren. I will model. I'm going to turn this off so she can turn hers on. All righty, hello, everyone. Thanks for having me. I'm Lauren. Lauren Hund."
00:01:21,Speaker A,"I have a weird background. I have a PhD in static. And then I'm. And then I got tired of being a statistician, so I became an attorney and worked as an attorney for a little while. And I'm in between practice areas, and it coincided with the session. So it's my first session. Happy to be here. So the great thing about Lauren is that she is an attorney. The issue of germaneness really is a legal issue."
00:02:03,Speaker C,"The way we do this is that the day before we meet, Lauren, Lorraine Montoya, attorney, Sanders Moore, and Dennis Roche, our chiefs, will meet together to look to see if it's easy to put the bills that"
00:02:22,Speaker D,are germane in one pile
00:02:24,Speaker C,and those that aren't in another. There may be a middle that we have to talk about. So that's the way it's going to work. So let's
00:02:37,Speaker D,now hear from Sherry. About
00:02:39,Speaker C,"our budget and our frank. Thank you, Madam Chair. So, last year there was an increase in 1st, so we increased the allotment for postage 5,550, which is paid"
00:02:54,Speaker D,"by LCS. And so, your pieces of mail"
00:02:57,Speaker E,"would be$8,500. So, that's great. Also, for the budget in 2024, the total budget for the Senate was 2823750."
00:03:06,Speaker D,"This year, it's down to 2462600. And the"
00:03:09,Speaker E,"reason why it's lower is because that very first year, we did not"
00:03:15,Speaker D,know what we were going
00:03:16,Speaker A,"to be facing. So, we budgeted at the max. This time, we budgeted"
00:03:22,Speaker D,kind of middle part. We
00:03:24,Speaker A,"did give in this budget give staff theirselves. Move to approve You'll probably be legal right now. You can just sit there. Look your usual beautifulness. Okay, so let's talk about those three bills. We"
00:03:42,Speaker D,have messages from the governor
00:03:43,Speaker B,"for Senate Bill 1, 2, and 3. Is that correct? I'm going to turn this over to you, Lauren, just tell"
00:03:54,Speaker E,us about the messages from
00:03:55,Speaker D,"1, 2, and 3. Yeah, so I have"
00:03:58,Speaker E,"the messages with me if anybody wants to see them,"
00:04:03,Speaker D,"but it's messages 1, 2,"
00:04:04,Speaker F,"and 3, which correspond to Senate Bills 1, 2, and"
00:04:09,Speaker D,"3 by their numbers. Madam Pro Chem, could"
00:04:12,Speaker A,"we explain it further? Just well, so we'll pass the messages around so you can look at them. Senate Bill 1 is the medical compact. The governor, we read out the message today on the floor. Senate Bill 2 is the road bonding package. That message from the governor to approval of that was read on the floor. And Senate Bill 3 is the issue of the harm to self and others. I"
00:04:51,Speaker D,don't know some should have
00:04:52,Speaker G,"a better title, but that's the one that they keep using. And so we read the message from the governor on that on the floor. That answer your question. Yeah. Everybody, that the governor's messages all contain a specific bill"
00:05:13,Speaker A,"number. So all of the efforts. Years past where we kind of tried to figure out whether the message imported with a given bill or something like that, it's going to be looks like it's going to be"
00:05:33,Speaker F,"pretty restricted. She's giving the message only on a very specific bill number, not a topic. Maybe, maybe not. Well, we'll see as we go forward if"
00:05:46,Speaker A,"that's the case. But yes, I do think that's what she's trying to do: limit the messaging, and that's her prerogative. So she just started using the 202 numbers. We hadn't had that before, but there it is. Yes, Senator Stefani. So, Madam Pratem, if the I'm going to"
00:06:12,Speaker G,"use the harm to self bill, if somebody else introduced"
00:06:16,Speaker D,"a similar bill, would it"
00:06:18,Speaker A,be considered? Germaine? That will be the question
00:06:21,Speaker G,"for this committee. As I said, there will be some bills that are easy. You know, there's formula bills, budget bills, revenue bills. Then there will be the message bill. Pile. Then"
00:06:37,Speaker D,there will be the not germane no message.
00:06:40,Speaker G,And then there will be a pile. What
00:06:43,Speaker D,shall we do about this?
00:06:45,Speaker G,"And that's the purpose of this. But today,"
00:06:48,Speaker D,these are pretty clear. Senator
00:06:49,Speaker F,"Padilla. You just said what I was saying, which is this, yeah, it's super clear what this applies. It probably is. Any other questions? Senator Menoz. And I know we're rushed today, but maybe staff just kind of learned a lesson attached to the message to the bill so"
00:07:15,Speaker A,"that we have the correct 202 number, right? But if the governor sends"
00:07:21,Speaker D,down a message and before
00:07:22,Speaker A,"the bill comes out of drafting, if they change the 202 number, because it's a different version. Yeah, it's the same language, but not the same number. Just something to think about. Dohick. So none of the 202 numbers in these messages had the point anything. And so I know on the medical compact, we're on a point 0.8. So I'd I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see points. But I thought last 30-day session, she was also using 202 numbers. Yeah, and the approach we took was"
00:08:10,Speaker G,"even if it didn't have the same 202 number, if it was sufficiently"
00:08:16,Speaker A,"similar, that it could come under point. Well, I don't remember that in detail, but we'll make it up as we go along. This is a new year. Sounds good. And we are being webcast, so I should probably tell the universe that this is the committee's committee. It's a procedural administrative committee. We don't listen to bills. We don't debate bills other than whether or not they're germane or not. We don't really take public comment because we're not talking about bills. It used to be that you could come to this committee and you could fight like hell to get your bill to be germane, whether it was or not. We're trying to not do"
00:09:19,Speaker D,"that, or we're trying to follow the letter of the law and we"
00:09:25,Speaker A,"don't. Like that letter of the law, we should do a two 60-day sessions where we don't have this anymore. All right, any other"
00:09:37,Speaker D,"comments about Senate Bill 1,"
00:09:39,Speaker H,"2, and 3? Any motion? I move that we determine"
00:09:43,Speaker D,"Senate Bills 1, 2, and"
00:09:45,Speaker A,"3 are germane. Second. I think everybody did a second. Any opposition to that move? Seeing none, those three bills will be germane and we'll be reporting them out."
00:10:00,Speaker D,"So, Sanders, now is the"
00:10:01,Speaker A,"time to pass out the committee list. So, Senator Wirth"
00:10:06,Speaker E,and I worked for quite
00:10:07,Speaker D,a bit with Senator Sher
00:10:09,Speaker A,"and Senator Woods in the interim. I'll just talk about for the Democratic side, we had some people with health issues that really necessitated doing a few movements. We had to incorporate our new Senator Rex Wilson into the committees rather than just putting. Him where Nicholas Paul was. He comes with a healthcare background, and so we were able to put him into the health care. So, and you see, Senator Bratley, that we're inviting you to be on the committee's committee. That's why I said your name today. So, no, not at all. That was made way before. All right. I'll just give you"
00:11:06,Speaker D,all a minute to go
00:11:07,Speaker E,"through it. Madam Chair, I know what the Republican changes"
00:11:12,Speaker A,"were. Can you point out the Democrat? Absolutely. So, in conservation, Senator Debbie"
00:11:18,Speaker H,"O'Malley has been added to the committee, and Senator Harold Pope has been moved down. to health. There are no changes in education. Yes. There is no change in education, no change in finance. As I said, in health, Senator Harold Pope has been moved to health. Senator Sedilla Lopez has been moved from health. and will serve on the Judiciary Committee. And as you see, you see"
00:11:54,Speaker E,Rex Wilson on it. No
00:11:55,Speaker A,changes for Indian Rural and Cultural Affairs in Judiciary. Senator Debbie O'Malley has been moved off of judiciary and Senator Antoinette Sedilla-Lopez placed on
00:12:07,Speaker I,judiciary along with the Republican Change. No changes to rules or tax. And for the committee's
00:12:15,Speaker A,"committees, we've added... And will you explain the Republican changes? So thank you, Madam Chair. So we took Senator"
00:12:24,Speaker I,Townsend off of conservation and replaced him with Senator Thornton. Vice versa on judiciary. So Senator
00:12:31,Speaker D,Townsend is now on judiciary. So that was that. Senator
00:12:36,Speaker I,Boone was moved off of health to make room for
00:12:40,Speaker D,Senator Wilson. And Senator Boone
00:12:42,Speaker E,"was moved to judiciary. And then, of course,"
00:12:45,Speaker I,we added Senator Brantley in place of Senator Brant. You
00:12:49,Speaker D,did such a good job
00:12:51,Speaker E,"working together. It's pretty fun. Wear our kilts the next time. All right, any other questions about the committees? Senator Woods."
00:13:01,Speaker D,I see a O'Miley on
00:13:03,Speaker A,"tax. Yes. What's her other committee? It's now conservation. It was health. No, it was judiciary. Sorry. Now conservation. She's got those two committees. And then you moved Hope off of conservation."
00:13:19,Speaker E,Conservation. So what's his second
00:13:21,Speaker D,health? Health is his one
00:13:22,Speaker A,committee. What's his other committee? Education. Yep. I'm
00:13:25,Speaker G,good. Okay. All right. Any other questions? I'll
00:13:28,Speaker A,"accept a motion. Motion. Motion to approve. Any opposition to the approval for the seeing none? We will go to the floor. One question. Are we going to have a set time for every day? Yeah. If we're going quicker, we might try"
00:13:51,Speaker D,to move it. But floor will be 11.
00:13:54,Speaker A,Committees committee 10.30. And we're going to do that this week. Do it in the next week. If we
00:14:03,Speaker D,"need less time, we'll change the because this took us 15 minutes. Same place. Same place. 10.30. All right. So back to the floor to approve this so we can start our. committees. If we don't approve this, we can't start the committees."
