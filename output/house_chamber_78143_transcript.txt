[38:55] SPEAKER_12:
move we go to that order of business announcements and miscellaneous business. See no objections? It is so ordered. Thank you, members, for indulging. Moment of silence, I just been a heavy weekend for all of us. I know at a time of such political dysfunction and the threats of political violence against members of this House sometimes, but also members of the public, as in the case of Mr. Pritty, are a reminder of the responsibility we each hold within our legislative roles, within as members of this House and this legislature. As I've said over and over again, I have nothing but respect for each and every single one of you, regardless of political and ideological differences. Violence is never the answer. I hope that we continue to move in that spirit over the next few weeks. I know that we can. I've seen us do it many times. So, again, thank you for indulging. Moment of silence. And may God bless us all in our journey over the next 20-plus days. And of course, may God bless our country as she

[40:25] SPEAKER_06:
continues to heal from what's been happening. Announcements. We have the gentlelady from Doñana with some introductions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today on the rostrum, I've got some guests. We've got Tyler Overberger. He is the chair of the Messiah Valley Day in Santa Fe. If you'd like to stand. We've got Kevin Merhedge, board chair for the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce. And lastly, I'd like to introduce Debbie Moore. She is the president and CEO of the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce. And today we celebrate her extraordinary 40-year career working with the Chamber of Commerce, including her. Her impactful service with the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce, defined by dedication, leadership, and lasting influence. Debbie has been a cornerstone not only in the Las Cruces, but within the chambers in Albuquerque, Hobbes, and Rio Rancho, helping shape their missions and strengthening their reach across New Mexico. Beginning with her first legislative session in 1990, I don't know if you were born yet, Mr. Speaker, in 1990. Debbie went on to work with six governors, providing community, deep institutional knowledge, and the steady, trusted voice for the region's business community. For more than 25 years, she has tirelessly advocated for businesses, large and small, and leaves a legacy of service that will be felt long after she is her well-earned retirement. And so, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to especially acknowledge her today. Welcome to the House and thank you, Debbie, for all of your years of service. I know you started when you were in daycare doing all that good economic development work.

[42:04] SPEAKER_12:
I've had the honor to convene with Debbie. I think it was a couple years ago you hosted us for a business roundtable with Chairwoman Gallegos and several other members of this House, and very appreciative of that time. I think we might have been talking cannabis. I don't remember, but it was good. It was a good conversation. We were talking cannabis, not over cannabis or doing cannabis, just talking about it. Talking about it. Be very clear. Welcome and thank you and congratulations on your retirement. I hope you have incredible plans ready to go. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And

[42:52] SPEAKER_06:
we also have people in the gallery from the chamber, if you would acknowledge them. As well, and from the Messiah Day in Santa Fe Committee. Certainly, gentlelady, we have in the gallery, please rise

as I call your names to be recognized. We've got four guests from the New Mexico Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research: Andrea Kiskaden, Senior Business Manager, Brittany Vander Wolf, Communications and Outreach Manager, Cynthia Airy, Program Coordinator, and Dustin Allen, IT Project Manager. Welcome to the House. And I'm sorry if I butchered some of your names. My apologies. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And

[43:38] SPEAKER_06:
also on your desk, if you'll notice that there are business holders that also they brought up as gifts for legislators today, I wanted to say thank you for those and acknowledge that they were also here. And, you know, there's lots of people. Here within the Doniana community, and I just wanted to thank them for making that trip. We're not so used to the snow, so coming up and bearing the hard weather. And I know that they were tough soldiers all weekend and still made it to every reception possible. So I appreciate that, and welcome to the House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Welcome, welcome to the House. Thank you for

[44:21] SPEAKER_12:

[44:30] SPEAKER_07:
everyone. I am proud to sponsor EPSCoR today in the House of Representatives. And EPSCORE, hold on, EPSCoR is represented today on the rostrum by Dr. Ganesh Balakrishman. He is Director of New Mexico EPSCoR. He holds a PhD in optical science and engineering from the University of New Mexico and conducts photonic research related to semiconductors. Thank you. Welcome to the House. Mr. Speaker, I also have Dr. Selena Connolly, who is the Associate Director of EPSCoR. She holds a PhD in curriculum and instruction from Texas Tech University and is a proud graduate of Las Cruces High School. Welcome to the House. Bulldogs. Is that right? Bulldogs.

[45:17] SPEAKER_12:
Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you a little

[45:21] SPEAKER_07:
bit about what EPSCoR does. EPSCoR, it's the established program to stimulate competitive research and is a program started by the National Science Foundation to help higher ed, government, and businesses work together in science and technology projects. And currently, EPSCoR is working to solve three big problems in New Mexico. First, they're working to ensure that all New Mexico institutions can participate in research and innovation through the Research Infrastructure Optimization of New Mexico with the Rio New Mexico project. And those institutions are the University of New Mexico, New Mexico State, New Mexico Tech, and Navaco Tech. The second problem, and this affects everyone, how to monitor forests and rivers so we can better protect them after disasters like wildfires. And the third big problem EPSCoR is looking at is how to strengthen advancing manufacturing through research and workforce development. And we need that for everything we're doing. And how New Mexico EPSCoR stands out, its impact is to make, it makes a huge impact on our state. First, it has invested more than$100 million in research. It has secured$12 million in additional research funding since 2021. They are training and supporting more than 2,000 researchers. They are investing more than$7 million in research equipment and tools. They are establishing 32 new faculty in high-impact science and engineering disciplines. And they are connecting all of New Mexico's higher education institutions to New Mexico's national research. Laboratories. In their program, the main goals are to support students who want to study science and engineering, yay, and to help improve science and engineering in ways that last in New Mexico, and to encourage research in important topics for New Mexico. So, that is EPSCoR, and they have given you this beautiful beaker. So, you can measure how much water you drink because we have to keep drinking that water. Only water. Only water, that's right. As someone

[47:25] SPEAKER_12:
in our

[47:26] SPEAKER_07:
other committee talked about. So, thank you for being here, and thank you for honoring EPSCoR today. Thank you. Thank you, EBSCORE,

[47:35] SPEAKER_12:
for being here today. And thank you for explaining what EPSCoR was, because I legit was going to ask, and somebody please tell me what it does. So, that was very helpful. Thank you, gentlelady. Gentlelady from Doña Ana, and also from Ciera and Catron and Valencia. No, I'm

[47:59] SPEAKER_10:
sorry, hold on. I'm still rusty. Gentlelady from Doñana, Sierra and Socorro, Rup Samdao. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am standing today to celebrate Ski New Mexico Day. Anna is walking around with your pass. You do have to sign for because this is a very, very nice little gift for us and our families. And boy, we sure take advantage of that with my family. Prior to this weekend, we were using artisan snow. You know, it's the handcrafted snow where you have to really maneuver yourself carefully down the slopes. But this, now we got some powder, some soft, fluffy snow. So I have two guests today on the rostrum. And the first one is Christy Germscheid. She is the executive director of Ski New Mexico. Go ahead and stand up. Welcome to the house. She's been with the ski industry for 28 years. She was previously the vice president of Angel Fire Resort and made the move to Ski New Mexico in 2024, where she welcomed the opportunity to advocate for the ski industry throughout the state of New Mexico. Thank you so much. And our next is John Paul Bradley, and he is the general manager at Sipapu Ski and Summer Resort. The resort started. He started at the resort in 2021 as a mountain manager, and he's been the general manager now since 2020. See Papu is proud to have commissioned the new chairlift this past weekend, which is a continuation of many of their capital improvements over the last several years with more to come. I don't know, I think I've been to the majority of the New Mexico ski resorts, but Sipapu is definitely the standard go-to if you're taking a whole bunch of kids on field trips and groups and camps. And Sipapu is a lot of fun. So I look forward to seeing those improvements. And we just are

[50:06] SPEAKER_12:
so, so appreciative of the snow. And for me, it is just another promise that we have. As long as the earth remains, there will always be seed time and harvest. There will always be summer and winter. And I'm just so. Grateful that somebody else has got this under control. Thank you, and welcome to your

[50:39] SPEAKER_01:
guest. Certainly, it was a blessing to have that snow this weekend. Hopefully, we get more of it. Hopefully, it remains on the mountain as snowpack so that we can have water later this year. And remember, do not eat the yellow snow. Had to remind my kid of that this weekend. I was like, nope, don't use that one. That's not a good snowball. It's yellow. I'm right, right? Gentlelady from Santa Fe. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You'll see on your desks today a big brown box. A land of enchantment awaits. And I'm happy to be the sponsor of this amazing box with all these goodies inside. Enjoy. And I want to give a big thank you. To New Mexico True, the New Mexico Tourism Department, Secretary Lansing Adams, and the entire staff for your leadership and hard work in showcasing the unique spirit of our state. Because of your efforts, New Mexico welcomed a record-setting 42.6 million visitors, generating$8.8 billion in direct visitor spending, contributing to a$12 billion total economic impact, and supporting over 95,000 jobs across our state and communities. Your dedication not only celebrates our culture and beauty, but strengthens our economy and quality of life. So if you see any of the New Mexico True, any of our tourism folks around, give them a thank you. And this is them appreciating us by giving us this well-welcome box of goodies. Enjoy it and get out and visit your

[52:10] SPEAKER_12:
ski since it's a day, ski day, get out. And go skiing, but if it skiing is not for you, there's lots of food to eat, there's lots of activities to do, and all that brings a healthy economy to our state. Thank you. Thank you, gentlelady. For the announcements, I've got an
