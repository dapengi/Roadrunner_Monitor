Moment of silence, I just been a heavy weekend for all of us. I know at a time of such political dysfunction and the threats of political violence against members of this House sometimes, but also members of the public, as in the case of Mr. Pritty, are a reminder of the responsibility we each hold within our legislative roles, within as members of this House and this legislature. As I've said over and over again, I have nothing but respect for each and every single one of you, regardless of political and ideological differences. Violence is never the answer. I hope that we continue to move in that spirit over the next few weeks. I know that we can. I've seen us do it many times. So, again, thank you for indulging. Moment of silence.

We've got Kevin Merhedge, board chair for the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce. And lastly, I'd like to introduce Debbie Moore. She is the president and CEO of the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce. And today we celebrate her extraordinary 40-year career working with the Chamber of Commerce, including her. Her impactful service with the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce, defined by dedication, leadership, and lasting influence. Debbie has been a cornerstone not only in the Las Cruces, but within the chambers in Albuquerque, Hobbes, and Rio Rancho, helping shape their missions and strengthening their reach across New Mexico. Beginning with her first legislative session in 1990, I don't know if you were born yet, Mr. Speaker, in 1990. Debbie went on to work with six governors, providing community, deep institutional knowledge, and the steady, trusted voice for the region's business community. For more than 25 years, she has tirelessly advocated for businesses, large and small, and leaves a legacy of service that will be felt long after she is her well-earned retirement. And so, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to especially acknowledge her today. Welcome to the House and thank you, Debbie, for all of your years of service. I know you started when you were in daycare doing all that good economic development work."

EPSCoR, it's the established program to stimulate competitive research and is a program started by the National Science Foundation to help higher ed, government, and businesses work together in science and technology projects. And currently, EPSCoR is working to solve three big problems in New Mexico. First, they're working to ensure that all New Mexico institutions can participate in research and innovation through the Research Infrastructure Optimization of New Mexico with the Rio New Mexico project. And those institutions are the University of New Mexico, New Mexico State, New Mexico Tech, and Navaco Tech. The second problem, and this affects everyone, how to monitor forests and rivers so we can better protect them after disasters like wildfires. And the third big problem EPSCoR is looking at is how to strengthen advancing manufacturing through research and workforce development. And we need that for everything we're doing. And how New Mexico EPSCoR stands out, its impact is to make, it makes a huge impact on our state. First, it has invested more than$100 million in research. It has secured$12 million in additional research funding since 2021. They are training and supporting more than 2,000 researchers. They are investing more than$7 million in research equipment and tools. They are establishing 32 new faculty in high-impact science and engineering disciplines. And they are connecting all of New Mexico's higher education institutions to New Mexico's national research. Laboratories. In their program, the main goals are to support students who want to study science and engineering, yay, and to help improve science and engineering in ways that last in New Mexico, and to encourage research in important topics for New Mexico. So, that is EPSCoR, and they have given you this beautiful beaker. So, you can measure how much water you drink because we have to keep drinking that water. Only water. Only water, that's right.

Anna is walking around with your pass. You do have to sign for because this is a very, very nice little gift for us and our families. And boy, we sure take advantage of that with my family. Prior to this weekend, we were using artisan snow. You know, it's the handcrafted snow where you have to really maneuver yourself carefully down the slopes. But this, now we got some powder, some soft, fluffy snow. So I have two guests today on the rostrum. And the first one is Christy Germscheid. She is the executive director of Ski New Mexico. Go ahead and stand up. Welcome to the house. She's been with the ski industry for 28 years. She was previously the vice president of Angel Fire Resort and made the move to Ski New Mexico in 2024, where she welcomed the opportunity to advocate for the ski industry throughout the state of New Mexico. Thank you so much. And our next is John Paul Bradley, and he is the general manager at Sipapu Ski and Summer Resort. The resort started. He started at the resort in 2021 as a mountain manager, and he's been the general manager now since 2020. See Papu is proud to have commissioned the new chairlift this past weekend, which is a continuation of many of their capital improvements over the last several years with more to come. I don't know, I think I've been to the majority of the New Mexico ski resorts, but Sipapu is definitely the standard go-to if you're taking a whole bunch of kids on field trips and groups and camps. And Sipapu is a lot of fun. So I look forward to seeing those improvements. And we just are"

      "text": "I have an announcement. Members, deadline to draft bills and capital outlay. Actually, let me take a step back. Capital Outlay. Capital Outlay will be spearheaded by the Honorable Chairman of the Tax Committee, along with a team consisting of the gentlelady from Ta\u00f1ana, the gentlelady from Bern Lillo, and I believe the gentleman from San Juan. I'm getting thumbs up. That work has already started, as I understand, and they'll get us figures and numbers and all that good stuff in due time. The deadline to draft bills, Sunday, February 1st by 5 p.m. Any requests must be received by Legislative Council Service by 5 p.m. on Sunday, February 1st. And then the deadline to introduce bills will be Wednesday, February 4th. Also, the New Mexico Motor Vehicle Division, otherwise known as the MVD, will be in the House Lounge all day tomorrow. They will be here to assist you with your vehicle titles, placard renewals, license plates, and other items related to your vehicles. Tomorrow in the lounge for the new members, newish members, take advantage. Don't let your license plate lapse like some people that I know. Me. The red plate means nothing when you've got an expired tag or you're speeding or anything. Trust me. Gentleman from Santa Fe. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The House Energy, Environment, and Natural Resources Committee will meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 in room 317. Do not bring your own burritos because we will have burritos. Wow, this is a first for the House Energy, Environment, and Natural Resources Committee. I wonder why. Any other announcements? Any other announcements? Okay, gentlelady from Santa Fe. Mr. Speaker, I move that the House stand in recess until 11 a.m. tomorrow morning. We'll see you tomorrow at 11.7:11."
