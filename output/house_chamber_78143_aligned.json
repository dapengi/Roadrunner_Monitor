She is the president and CEO of the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce. And today we celebrate her extraordinary 40-year career working with the Chamber of Commerce, including her. Her impactful service with the Greater Las Cruces Chamber of Commerce, defined by dedication, leadership, and lasting influence. Debbie has been a cornerstone not only in the Las Cruces, but within the chambers in Albuquerque, Hobbes, and Rio Rancho, helping shape their missions and strengthening their reach across New Mexico. Beginning with her first legislative session in 1990, I don't know if you were born yet, Mr. Speaker, in 1990. Debbie went on to work with six governors, providing community, deep institutional knowledge, and the steady, trusted voice for the region's business community. For more than 25 years, she has tirelessly advocated for businesses, large and small, and leaves a legacy of service that will be felt long after she is her well-earned retirement. And so, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to especially acknowledge her today."
